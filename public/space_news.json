At other events this week, representatives from those companies will be sharing their plans. It’s day 33 of the partial government shutdown. House Speaker Mike Johnson decided on Friday to keep the House out of legislative session for yet another week. The shutdown can only end if enough Senate Democrats/Independents decide to vote with most Republicans. There are quite a few interesting events here and overseas. There are lots of great meetings and conferences on tap this week. We highlight a few names that probably are familiar to the readers of this website. There does not appear to be a virtual option.

The 45th Weather Squadron forecast a 95 percent chance for favorable weather at liftoff with just a small chance for interference from cumulus clouds. Starcloud believes that its future space-based data centers can be “ten times cheaper than land-based options” Philip Johnston predicted that “In 10 years, nearly all new data centers will be being built in outer space” Germany-based Exolaunch is responsible for manifesting and deploying 13 out of the 18 payloads flying."

This variant of the Starship is set to be one of the landers for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Artemis program. The ship will operate alongside tankers and depots to refuel, enabling it to deliver not only people but also approximately 100 tons of cargo to the lunar surface. SpaceX has completed 49 milestones so far in the development of HLS. Docking adapter qualification has been achieved in conjunction with NASA and Lockheed. Landing leg testing, which included the dropping of a full-scale article at flight energies onto simulated lunar regolith, has also been completed. SpaceX currently has two test tanks at their Masseys test area. The first full flight test of Block 3 is scheduled to involve Booster 18 and Ship 39 and is expected to launch sometime in Quarter 1 of 2026. Currently, neither vehicle is complete in construction, and, based on the best timelines using past boosters and ships as reference points, neither will likely begin cryogenic proof testing until December. Ship 39 has a few noticeable changes, even though it is only a couple of sections into stacking. SpaceX has refined the design of the ship catch pins and relocated them to the nosecone. The common dome has moved down slightly, which means SpaceX will be able to load more LCH4 into the tank. Another significant addition is a probe-and-drogue docking system."
