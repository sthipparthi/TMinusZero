NASA administrator Sean Duffy said he was reworking the agency’s lunar lander contracts because SpaceX had fallen behind. Duffy sought to demonstrate to the rest of the space community that he was willing to stand up to SpaceX. Musk channeled his inner Trump and called out ‘Sean Dummy’ A fierce, behind-the-scenes battle rages on among camps supporting Duffy and Isaacman to decide the leadership of NASA.

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk downplayed the urgency of beating China, advocating instead for long-term sustainability. Lockheed Martin indicated it has been quietly developing a “safe solution to return humans to the Moon as quickly as possible” The announcement has left many questions unanswered, including the timeline for the new competition, proposal deadlines, and funding sources."

Despite being preliminary, these images mark a major milestone in Europe’s ability to monitor air quality all the way from geostationary orbit, 36 000 kilometres above Earth. Ozone high up in the stratosphere plays a crucial role in shielding life on Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. But ozone in the lower atmosphere acts as a pollutant, contributing to poor air quality and respiratory problems. Overall ozone levels here are within the expected range. The large-scale distribution, featuring a maximum over the Balkans and Greece and a minimum over the Baltic region, is consistent with patterns detected on the same day."

Duffy indirectly acknowledged that NASA’s projected target of a 2027 crewed lunar landing is no longer achievable. He said he intended to expand the competition to develop a lander capable of carrying humans down to the Moon. NASA would not easily be able to rip up its existing HLS contracts with SpaceX and Blue Origin. SpaceX founder Elon Musk, responding to Duffy’s comments, seemed to relish the challenge posed by industry competitors. “SpaceX is moving like lightning compared to the rest of the space industry,” Musk said on the social media site he owns."

Duffy wants competition and innovation from Blue Origin and other U.S. companies. He also acknowledged publicly for the first time that Artemis III will not launch in mid-2027, the most recent target. Former NASA astronaut Bob Behnken, now Vice President of Exploration and Technology Strategy for Lockheed Martin Space, told SpacePolicyOnline.com that the company has been analyzing HLS options with a cross-industry team all year. In a reply to one of Duffy’s posts, Elon Musk said SpaceX is “moving like lightning compared to the rest of the space industry” and “Starship will end up doing the whole Moon mission.” SpaceX and Blue Origin are working on landing missions on the Moon. The goal is to get Americans back there by the end of Trump’s term on January 20, 2029 and before China. The plan is to alternate between the two companies for one NASA lunar landing mission per year thereafter. NASA confirmed to SpacePolicyOnline.com last week that Duffy has been interviewing candidates, including Isaacman, to be the permanent Administrator. But the WSJ is first to report that Duffy actually wants to keep the job himself. This article has been updated to reflect the new information."

There are no other international missions scheduled at the time of publishing. Persistent bad weather expected throughout this week at the Tanegashima Space Center has pushed this launch to the weekend. The first Falcon 9 launch of the week will launch from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) on Wednesday, Oct. 22. Onboard will be the second of two SPAINSAT NG (“New Generation”) satellites, which replace the current SpainSat and XTAR-EUR communications satellites in geostationary orbit. This second-generation constellation is operator Hisdesat’s largest project yet, incorporating modern technical advances in communications. An additional Starlink mission is scheduled to launch from SLC-4E at the Vandenberg Space Force Base on Monday, Oct. 27. Another batch of 28 Starlink v2-Mini satellites will be onboard. Booster B1082 will be taking its 17th flight and is expected to land on the droneship Of Course I Still Love You approximately eight minutes into the mission. The booster has been in service since early January 2024 and has predominantly launched Starlink missions."

On Tuesday, former NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and Axiom Space’s Vice President of Human Spaceflight Peggy Whitson will discuss “The U.S. Enduring Human Presence in Orbit: Reflecting on the Future and Past 25 Years” There are far too many interesting events this week to summarize here, but one more we’ll highlight is the 7th annual Summit for Space Sustainability in Paris. The HTV-X1 launch has not been announced, but it could well take place this week. Check back throughout the week for others we learn about later and add to our Calendar. We do not post comments that include links to other websites since we have no control over that content nor can we verify the security of such links."

The decision clears the path for the redevelopment of the historic Space Launch Complex 6 (SLC-6), enabling up to 100 annual Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches from the site. Up to five Falcon Heavy missions per year are now feasible. SLC-6 was originally built to host the US Air Force's Shuttle program. The 1986 Challenger disaster derailed those plans, leading to decommissioning in 1989. ULA’s departure left the pad dormant, opening the door for SpaceX to transform it into a Falcon-capable hub. The dual-pad setup could double West Coast throughput."

With its successful splashdown and Boosters successful demonstrations, this flight marks the close of the 2025 Starship campaign. 2026 will introduce the next iteration of Starship and Superheavy, V3, on the completely redesigned launch pad at Tower 2. Pad 1 began stacking in early 2021, eventually being completed later that year. Ship 24 and Booster 7 took flight on the hazy morning of April 20th, 2023 from Pad 1, marking the first full stack flight from the first iteration of the Orbital Launch Mount (OLM) Ship 25 became the first Starship to reach space, though it would not return.  2025 was set to be a key year for the Starship program, but unfortunately SpaceX’s hopes for a high flight rate were met with setback after setback due to the newly introduced V2 ships. The launch of Flight 7 on January 16th, 2025 marked the first launch of the second version of the Starship upper stage. Starbase’s Gigabay is well under way at the location of the original High Bay. The future for Starship remains in flux, with pressure mounting from NASA to have it ready for Artemis III. 2026 is set to be a new era for not only Starbase, but for the Starship program."

The spacecraft made the roughly seven-mile journey from the Launch Abort System Facility to the VAB. The trek came almost four years to the day after NASA rolled the Orion spacecraft used on the Artemis 1 mission. The first crewed flight of the Artemis program is set to launch no earlier than Feb. 5 from the Kennedy Space Center. Teams are still working to nail down the specific launch windows available to them in each month. Depending on exactly when they launch, the four-person crew will spend roughly ten days in the confines of the Orion capsule."
