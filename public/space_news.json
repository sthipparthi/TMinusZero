The goal is to fly around the Moon, but the spacecraft and life support systems first must pass tests in Earth orbit before NASA decides to execute the Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI) burn. The crew said today enabling Artemis III is their measure of success. Space weather is caused by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Sun. CMEs create breathtaking auroras on Earth, but also can disrupt electrical systems and orbiting satellites. Artemis II crew can shelter in Orion’s storage compartments if there is a CME during their 10-day flight."

Rocks outside the crater rim, 90 kilometers away (about 56 miles) were taken with the remote micro-imager of ChemCam and with added Mastcam context.

Shiyan-12 (02) made a close approach Sept. 11 to an early warning satellite. Shiyan satellites are experimental spacecraft which analysts believe are used to trial new systems. The series appear to have been used for a range of purposes, including technology demonstrations. While many Shiyan satellites operate in low Earth or near-polar orbits, a number have recently headed to GEO, while the Shiyan-10 designation satellites entered Molniya orbits."
