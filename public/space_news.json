SpaceX launched its 100th Falcon 9 rocket of the year Monday morning. Students from Concordia University cheered and whistled as the Starsailor rocket lifted off on Cree territory on August 15. This was Canada's first space launch in more than 25 years, and the first to be achieved by a team of students, according to the university. SpaceX has not had a good run of things with the ambitious Starship vehicle this year. Three times, in January, March, and May, the vehicle took flight. Sources at SpaceX believe the upper stage issues can be resolved. But the acid test will only come on upcoming flights, beginning Sunday. Engineers recreated the diffuser failure on the ground during the investigation. They then redesigned the part to better direct pressurized gas into the main fuel tank. This will also \"substantially decrease\" strain on the Diffuser structure, SpaceX said. The Falcon 9 is scheduled to launch on August 22."

Vehicle 1 is scheduled to launch atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 from the Kennedy Space Center on Thursday, August 21, at 11:50 PM EDT (03:50 UTC on Friday, Aug. 22) The launch window is just under four hours long and lasts until 3:40 AM EDT (07:40 UTC) on Friday morning. After liftoff, Falcon 9 will follow a northeast trajectory to loft the OTV into a low-Earth orbit, possibly a circular orbit at 500 km altitude inclined 49.5 degrees to the equator. OTV-8 will demonstrate laser communications using proliferated low-Earth orbit (LEO) communications satellite networks. Laser communications can carry higher data bandwidth due to the shorter wavelength of infrared light versus radio waves. The quantum inertial sensor experiment is also an effort to increase resiliency in military space systems. The X-37B OTV is a spaceflight-capable spacecraft. It is nearly nine meters long and features a 4.5 m wingspan. The spaceplane’s capacity to fly experiments was increased when a non-reusable service module for use in space was added to the design."

This is two times as large as SpaceX's main Falcon 9 factory in Hawthorne, California. The ultimate goal of this factory is to build one Starship rocket a day. SpaceX has not had a good run of things with the ambitious Starship vehicle this year. Three times, in January, March, and May, the vehicle took flight. The vehicle's tenth test flight is scheduled to take place no earlier than August 24. Success with Starship would solve a lot of problems for SpaceX. SpaceX's Starship program has been so disappointing this year. There will be a lot of learning, and almost certainly some failures, as SpaceX works through these technical milestones. If it continues to have teething pains, though, that makes it easier for Congress to continue funding NASA's expensive rocket and spacecraft, as it would prefer to do. Musk is highly critical of Artemis, saying NASA should focus on Mars. Both the Moon and Mars versions of Starship require the vehicle to reach orbit and successfully refuel. If Artemis is not a priority for Musk, how can it be for SpaceX? This all creates a tremendous amount of uncertainty ahead of Sunday's Starship launch."

Artemis II is a test flight that will not attempt even to orbit the Moon, much less land. The four-person American-Canadian crew will fly a free-return trajectory taking them past the Moon and back to Earth. Cruz posted a video of the JSC visit and wrote that he is “making sure we have the tools we need to maintain American dominance in space,” but provided no details about the fate of the $10 billion. He and Babin wrote to Duffy on August 5 asking for details on when and how it will be spent. NASA laid out an architecture for routine flights beyond that, including assembling a lunar Gateway space station. The Trump Administration wants to kill not only Gateway, but SLS and Orion after Artemis III and replace them with commercial alternatives. Congress disagrees, pointing out commercial alternatives don’t exist yet."

It also helps scientists predict how the Sun’s ultraviolet output affects Earth's upper atmosphere. Preliminary results show Surya is making strides in solar flare forecasting. Surya is designed to study the Sun, but its architecture and methodology are adaptable across scientific domains. The project lays the foundational infrastructure for similar AI efforts in diverse domains. Both the model and training datasets are freely available online to researchers, educators, and students worldwide. NASA's commitment to open science fuels groundbreaking research while maximizing transparency, innovation, and collaboration. NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery. The agency is based in Washington, D.C. and has offices around the world."

The BioNutrients-3 investigation is planned to launch to the space station in August 2025 aboard NASA’s SpaceX CRS-33 mission. It aims to develop a platform biomanufacturing technology that demonstrates microbial production of targeted nutrients for long-duration space missions. The concept is similar to making familiar fermented foods, such as how milk – transformed by bacteria – becomes yogurt. BioNutrients-3 includes the same commercial yogurt and kefir starters used in BioNutrient-2 and adds yeast strains that have been bioengineered to produce multiple nutrients in a single bag. The growth substrate – the ingredients needed to sustain the microorganisms as they grow, including a color-changing indicator of the level of acidity in the samples – is fully edible."

The housing at the rear of the Pad 2 tower base is substantially larger and more robust. Pad 2 chopsticks are approximately 10 metres shorter than Pad 1's; this is expected to improve responsiveness during catch attempts. The Pad 2 carriage incorporates a redesigned skate system, differing from the Pad 1 configuration. The pistons used for moving these chopsticks laterally are significantly simplified compared to those on Pad 1. The rigging layout on the Pad 2 tower differs from Pad 1’s regarding the placement of the drawworks and the dead spool & deadline anchor. The Pad 2 launch mount is equipped with two Booster Quick Disconnects (BQDs), as opposed to Pad 1’s single BQD. These two BQDs appear to be separated for liquid oxygen and liquid methane supply. The top surface of the launch mount incorporates a water-cooled steel plate, similar to the one implemented under Pad 1 since Flight 2. Pad 2 will only share storage tanks with Pad 1. The layout of the Pad 2 end of the tank farm is entirely different from Pad 1’s, likely based on extensive lessons learned from all prior Starship ground tests and launches. Pad 2 will have its dedicated liquid oxygen and liquid methane pumps and subcoolers, amongst other items of GSE-related hardware. Starbase Pad 2 is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2025. It will be the second Starbase Pad to be built in the U.S. The project is funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASASpaceflight.com)"

On August 6, the China Manned Space Agency successfully tested a high-fidelity mockup of its 26-ton \"Lanyue\" lunar lander. This work suggests that China is on course to land on the Moon before the end of this decade. Cheng: It seems quite likely that the Chinese will land on the Moon before NASA can return to the Moon. Cheng: If China regularly dispatches lunar missions, then it will rightfully be able to argue that Chinese should be the language of lunar/cis-lunar space traffic management. The Chinese are stable, systematic. They pursue a given goal (e.g., human spaceflight, a space station) over decades, with persistence and programmatic stability. So I expect that the Chinese will put a Chinese person on the Moon by 2030 and follow that with additional crewed and unmanned facilities. This will be supported by a built-out infrastructure of lunar PNT/comms."
