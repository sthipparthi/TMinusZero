The decision, made in response to rising tensions with Russia, has been hailed a “watershed moment” for the German and European space sector. Experts say could spur a new era in European space cooperation. The European Union, which is not directly linked to ESA, also has its own space budget. The EU’s lengthy procurement cycle and preference for established prime contractors has been criticized by the European space small- and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups. Meyer-Brunswick said that the new German space defense budget will finally allow the newcomers their chance to grow and shine.

As NASA prepares for Artemis missions to the Moon and sets sights on Mars, the space station continues to enable groundbreaking research not possible on Earth. The space station provides a testbed to refine these systems before human’s travel to distant destinations. Astronauts aboard the space station have collected photographs to document Earth’s surface through Crew Earth Observations. Now, those same techniques are being adapted for Artemis II , where astronauts will use handheld cameras to capture images of the Moon. Researchers have also advanced 3D printing in space , enabling astronauts to make tools and parts on-demand. Measurements taken on Artemis II crew will expand a repository of human health data. NASA researchers hope to use this data repository to develop protocols aimed at keeping astronauts healthy on missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Organ-chip research could improve crew prevention measures and create personalized medical treatments for humans, on Earth and in space."

The SWIM sensor can also be manufactured with a lightweight carbon-composite cover (or the cover can be omitted) to achieve a sensor mass of ~110 g. Using three smaller cores with improved metallurgy instead of six large racetrack cores reduced the power consumption by a factor of two. The MAGIC electronics use a traditional analog demodulator fluxgate and magnetic feedback design."

The flurry of activity highlights the company’s push toward operational readiness for Pad 2, including enhancements to water management and structural protections. The pad is set to host its first launch during Flight 12 of Starship in 2026. Pad 2 at Starbase is ramping up its testing ahead of hosting the next version of Starship, starting with Flight 12 next year. A key advantage over Pad 1 is the potential for same-day retests following an abort. Pad 2’s setup allows for quicker recovery and retry once the issue is resolved. The “Megabunker’ has emerged at the old launch site entrance. It resembles a fortified medieval fortress, sparking speculation about its purpose. Experts suggest it may house critical electronics and control equipment for pad operations. The next step involves fitting flex hoses to link the quick disconnects to ground systems."

And now it has become clear that a great wave stirs the motion of stars in our galaxy over distances of tens of thousands of light-years from the Sun. ‘This observed behaviour is consistent with what we would expect from a wave,’ says Eloisa Poggio from INAF in Italy. Young giant stars and Cepheids move with the wave. It is possible that young stars retain the memory of the wave information from the gas itself, from which they were born. Scientists do not know the origin of these galactic shakes. A past collision with a dwarf galaxy could be a possible explanation."
