Each MetOp-SG satellite is fitted with an extra thruster, enabling it to self-destruct in Earth’s atmosphere when the mission is complete. Main stage and solid rocket boosters are responsible for the first phase of flight. The stage is powered by the Vulcain 2.1 engine (fuelled by liquid oxygen and hydrogen), with the main thrust at liftoff provided by the P120C boosters.

The launch occurred on August 11, 2025, at 8:35 a.m. ET from Space Launch Complex 40. SpaceX has repurposed Falcon Heavy side boosters for Falcon 9 missions in the past, including the inaugural Falcon Heavy flight in 2018. The primary deterrent has been the added mass from reinforcements, estimated at 10-20% more than a standard Falcon 9 booster. During its return, observers noticed evidence of the booster’s heavier build during the KF-02 landing."

OCO-2 is now viewed as the gold standard for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) measurements from space. Scientists from around the world have come together to bring the important data from this satellite to the broader community. The first launch in 2009 ended in failure – when a faulty launch vehicle doomed the first OCO to a watery grave. In the aftermath, the OCO community were left in limbo, unsure if the project would survive. OCO-2 can detect the faint glow given off by plants during photosynthesis. This glow offers a fast, sensitive indicator of plant health – see Figure 2 . OCO-2 and MODIS provide a global dataset of plant photosynthesis far beyond what either satellite could produce on its own. OCO-2’s synergy with its A-Train counterpart, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’S Aqua platform, makes the data even more powerful. OCO-2 and OCO-3 provide complementary perspectives on Earth’s carbon cycle and plant health at space and time resolutions that have not been possible from space before. The satellite's high-precision measurements can now detect CO 2 linked not just to countries, but large cities, industrial zones, and even individual power plants – all while researchers continue perfecting efforts to identify contributions from city sectors. The Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) of Fourier Transform Spectrometers (FTS) measure CO 2 over snow-covered ground. OCO-2 was being used to develop early drought forecasts. The “ground truth” data collected at these field sites help to ensure that the satellite is accurately measuring “Earth’s breathing” During the 2015–2016 El Niño, large tropical forests temporarily transformed into net carbon sources. OCO-2 captured the increase in atmospheric CO 2 and scientists used this data to refine estimates of how these events contribute to the global carbon budget. Scientists are combining the satellite data with wind models and urban maps to trace CO 2 to its sources."

High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey will be split into two imaging “tiers” — a wide tier that covers more area and a deep tier that will focus on a smaller area for a longer time to detect fainter objects. The observations will take place in two areas, one in the northern sky and another in the southern sky. There will also be a spectroscopic component to this survey, which will be limited to the southern night sky."

One of those remains a mystery with Space Force officials unwilling to provide any details. The other, which is described as the primary payload onboard the Vulcan rocket is the brainchild of the Air Force Research Laboratory. The mission and launch together come with a $250 million price tag. NTS-3 is being tested in the laboratory as well as out in the field. Some of the learns from this, like calibrating a spot beam antenna, can be applied to the next generation of GPS satellites, called GPS 3-F. The prime contractor that manufactured the satellite is L3Harris Technologies."

The spacecraft is heading toward asteroid 65803 Didymos and its companion Dimorphos, on a mission to study the results of an intentional collision. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) crashed into Dimmorphos on Sept 26, 2022, intending to change the asteroid’'s course. Together, DART and Hera lay the foundations for future planetary protection missions. Team reprocessed to remove noise and enhance the visibility of individual pieces of debris. They identified 104 boulders ranging from 20 cm to 3.6 m in diameter, hurtling away from the asteroid at speeds up to 52 m/s. Many of these boulders were found outside the main dust plume, indicating that they might have originated from collisions with different parts of the spacecraft. Hera will deploy a pair of CubeSats that will help study the asteroids in more detail. The first, called Milani, will study the dust surrounding Dimorphos and take spectral images of both asteroids. The other spacecraft, named Juventas, will line up with Hera to perform radio science experiments and study the interior of Didymos. Missions like DART, Hera, and Ramses will help astronomers better understand asteroids and the threat they might pose to our planet and its inhabitants. These missions prepare space agencies and the space industry to quickly respond to these threats. All findings from these missions, including the tiny changes to Dimorphis’ orbital inclination, add to the body of knowledge that might eventually save our planet."

    "detailed_news": "Lovell was the oldest living former astronaut following the death of Frank Borman in 2023. Lovell’s career began in aviation, where he flew fighter jets, including a Western Pacific deployment aboard the aircraft carrier USS Shangri-La. He first ventured into space with the Gemini program, flying on Gemini 7 in 1965 and Gemini 12 in 1966. He later served as command module pilot on Apollo 8, the historic first crewed mission to orbit the Moon, before commanding Apollo 13. The Apollo 13 mission was a \"successful failure\" The mission spurred major safety redesigns in later Apollo spacecraft. Lovell retired from NASA in 1973 and pursued a successful career in the commercial sector. “We will miss his unshakeable optimism, his sense of humor, and the way he made each of us feel we could do the impossible,” his family said."

His memoir, Lost Moon, remains one of the most compelling accounts of the Apollo program and served as the basis for Apollo 13. Known among his peers as “Smilin’ Jim” for his sharp wit and easygoing demeanor, Lovell was admired for his unwavering optimism and approachability. Lovell is survived by his four children, and a legacy that has touched millions around the world. “Jim Lovell embodied the bold resolve and optimism of both past and future explorers, and we will remember him always,” - NASA’s Statement Survived by His Family"
