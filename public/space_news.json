    "detailed_news": "With help from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope in low-Earth orbit, scientists recently observed a Pluto-like object being “eaten” by its host star. The hungry star is a white dwarf — the dense, stellar core left behind after a low-mass star dies and blows away its outer layers. The white dwarf observed by Hubble is about the size of Earth but much heavier, at around half the mass of our Sun. The white dwarf was likely once a Sun-like star that hosted a suite of planets and circumstellar disks similar to the Kuiper Belt. As the fragments fall onto the white dwarf, the star accretes them, emitting primarily ultraviolet light and very little visible light. The team is planning to continue their observations of hungry white dwarfs in the infrared with the James Webb Space Telescope.

Stephen Whiting says. Whiting has been a proponent of closer “space-cyber-SOF” collaboration. The Air Force and the Space Force are studying options to field a new layer of AMTI satellites. “We want to be able to do a better job of helping to track those threats from space,” said Whiting. The discussions are taking place as the Pentagon embarks on an ambitious defense initiative. Companies will be challenged to design prototype SBI systems capable of intercepting missiles both within the atmosphere and after they enter space. “Like everyone in the industry, we’re following this,” Mitrevski said. � “We’m ready to provide solutions.”"

Their civilian/commercial uses include aerial photography/filming, agriculture, communications, conservation/wildlife monitoring, damage assessment/infrastructure inspection, law enforcement/security, search and rescue, weather monitoring and research. The 2025-2026 Dream with Us Design Challenge will focus on Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (UAS) and implementing UAS into the agriculture industry. This year’s mission is to develop an uncrewed aircraft system that will detect agricultural pests. Teams will work together with coaches and mentors to identify what is needed while pursuing the completion of this challenge. Agricultural pests cost billions of dollars in losses across the globe every year. The strategic use of uncrewed aircraft is making significant impacts in reducing the impact of agricultural pests. Properly implemented, agricultural output can be increased while also reducing resource use. This year’s challenge is to design Uncrewed Aircraft Systems. The successful proposal should include an estimate of the project’s budget as well as the potential cost savings. It is strongly recommended that teams conduct their own research on the topic to answer the following questions. The basic purpose of a concept of operations is to describe the characteristics of a system from the viewpoint of a user. The purpose of a detect-and-avoid system is to be able to sense objects that might pose a threat, detect if an object becomes a conflict (potential collision) During flight, the uncrewed aircraft may be operating near manned aircraft. Safety of people in other aircraft are a priority. Having a communications system that can handle the necessary tasks is essential. Any UAS performing remote sensing require a variety of roles to be fulfilled by personnel on the ground to ensure safe and successful completion of the mission. Different aircraft and application types will require different roles and different numbers of ground support personnel. Use this experience to better understand what roles would be required, at a minimum, to create your design from conception to final delivery. Cost of Personnel is the total costs for all personnel required to fly, reload, refuel, repair the UAV during the mission. This cost also includes the personnel cost during the time to complete the preparation and post-mission. To calculate fixed costs you must add up the costs of all components of your aircraft. For the Dream with Us 2025-2026 challenge, your team is asked to develop a set of materials to make the case to support the utilization of UAS. There may be a variety of types of media used depending on the plan developed by the team. Infographics are a method for communicating a lot of information using images words and numbers in an easier to understand way. The Scoring Rubric should be used as the headings in your Engineering Design Notebook. On the getting started section above, you will also find software, webinars, and a survey. Teams of judges will evaluate your work based on what you submit in your engineering design notebook."

This development raises serious questions about whether the long-awaited ‘baby shuttle’ will ever fulfill its original promise of delivering cargo to the orbiting laboratory. The Dream Chaser, a winged reusable spacecraft designed for atmospheric reentry and runway landings, has been plagued by delays. Sierra Space's Dream Chaser spacecraft has been in development since the 1990s. The first flight-ready vehicle, DC-101 Tenacity, arrived at Kennedy Space Center in May 2024 for final pre-launch preparations. With the ISS scheduled for deorbiting in 2031, the window for completing seven missions was already narrowing. Sierra Space is working with NASA on a demo of the Dream Chaser spacecraft. The shuttle-like craft could be used for resupply missions to the ISS. Sierra Space is also contributing hardware to Orbital Reef, a project led by Blue Origin. The company hopes the demo will get Dream Chaser off the ground."

Stoke Space, based in the Pacific Northwest, and Relativity, headquartered in Long Beach, California, plan to join SpaceX and Blue Origin in the spaceflight market with their own reusability-enabled launch vehicles. SpaceX NSF’s flyover imagery shows Starship-related progress underway at multiple sites. The Roberts Road facility is where pad items, both large and small, are fabricated or delivered. Five Starship tower segments were spotted at Roberts Road, with four of them completed, a fifth nearing completion, and work started on a sixth. SpaceX continues to make progress on the massive Giga Bay, which will be about half the size of NASA’s Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) Workers have poured a large amount of concrete and are installing four tower cranes in what will be the transfer aisles. SpaceX is also busy with changes to its existing Falcon 9 launch pad at SLC-40. Blue Origin Exploration Park is undergoing continued work and expansion. New Glenn Transporter was seen moving past the VAB on Sept. 21, which could indicate a possible rollout of New Glenn Flight 2’s Glenn Stage 1 first stage as soon as Oct. 5. Workers have conducted launch checkouts at LC-36 with the New Glenn Simulator in the meantime. Blue Origin also recently assembled and tested a large deployable sunshield at Lunar Plant 1, which will protect both Lunar Transporter and the Blue Moon Mk2 crewed lunar lander. NSF also showed progress on the NASA Artemis program’s ML2 parked by the VAB. The ML2 will not be used for the next two Artemis missions but will be needed for Artemis IV and subsequent missions, if these missions are flown. The SLS rocket for Artemis II is almost completely stacked with validation and checkouts complete, but still requires stacking of the Orion spacecraft and its launch abort system tower."
