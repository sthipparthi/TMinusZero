Astrobotic had been awarded a fixed price contract of $323 million to deliver VIPER to the lunar surface through CLPS. The lunar science community and Congress reacted negatively to the decision and NASA decided to issue a call for expressions of interest by organizations that might want to take over the project. Astrobotic said in an emailed statement today they had decided not to submit a bid."

    "detailed_news": "Hundreds of subglacial lakes form a crucial part of Antarctica’s icy structure, affecting the movement and stability of glaciers. Researchers have identified 85 previously unknown lakes several kilometres under the frozen surface surrounding the South Pole. The research also identified new drainage pathways underneath the ice sheet. This increases the number of known active sub glacial lakes below Antarctica by more than half. The biggest known subglacial lake is Lake Vostok underneath the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, holding an estimated 5000–65 000 cubic km of water. By monitoring such phenomena, scientists can improve their understanding of interactions between the ice sheet, bedrock, ocean and atmosphere. “Subglacial hydrology is a missing piece in many ice sheet models,” said Sally."

The turquoise colour in the water along the coasts and around the surrounding islets reveal the presence of shallow waters and coral reefs."
