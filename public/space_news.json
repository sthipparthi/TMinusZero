    "detailed_news": "Flight 11 was a largely successful test flight for the Starship Program, with Booster and Ship meeting all of their stated pre-flight goals. With its successful splashdown and Boosters successful demonstrations, this flight marks the close of the 2025 Starship campaign. 2026 will introduce the next iteration of Starship and Superheavy, V3, on the completely redesigned launch pad at Tower 2. Pad 1 began stacking in early 2021, eventually being completed later that year. Ship 24 and Booster 7 took flight on the hazy morning of April 20th, 2023 from Pad 1, marking the first full stack flight from the first iteration of the Orbital Launch Mount (OLM) Ship 25 became the first Starship to reach space, though it would not return.  2025 was set to be a key year for the Starship program, but unfortunately SpaceX’s hopes for a high flight rate were met with setback after setback due to the newly introduced V2 ships. The launch of Flight 7 on January 16th, 2025 marked the first launch of the second version of the Starship upper stage. Starbase’s Gigabay is well under way at the location of the original High Bay. The future for Starship remains in flux, with pressure mounting from NASA to have it ready for Artemis III. 2026 is set to be a new era for not only Starbase, but for the Starship program."

The spacecraft made the roughly seven-mile journey from the Launch Abort System Facility to the VAB. The trek came almost four years to the day after NASA rolled the Orion spacecraft used on the Artemis 1 mission. The first crewed flight of the Artemis program is set to launch no earlier than Feb. 5 from the Kennedy Space Center. Teams are still working to nail down the specific launch windows available to them in each month. Depending on exactly when they launch, the four-person crew will spend roughly ten days in the confines of the Orion capsule."

All 33 engines were running at liftoff, and unlike Flight 10, no engines shut off during the ascent. With the boost back complete, and for the final time, Booster 15-2 separated its hotstage ring to let it fall into the gulf. Super Heavy Booster 15-2 was down-selected from 13 engines to five engines, then down to three. This landing burn profile will enable more redundancy during the final adjustment phase of the landing burn, and allowing the booster to exert greater control over its trajectory. The booster entered a hover above the Gulf before shutting off all its engines, dropping into the water, and exploding. The day after launch, SpaceX released drone footage of the belly flop and landing. Flight 11 was a perfect send-off for Blocks 1 and 2 and for Pad 1 as SpaceX ends flight tests this year on a high note. Next up is Block 3, Raptor 3, and Pad 2(B) with Booster 18 and Ship 39. It is unclear when these vehicles will be ready for single-vehicle testing and eventually full-stack testing."

    "summary": "\nEvery new space mission runs into the same wall: physics and fragility. Physics, because the speed of light and contested spectrum make real-time decision-making from the ground impossible when you need it most. Fragility, because modern space systems are software-defined, interconnected, and therefore exposed to radiation-induced faults, cascading anomalies and increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.

At ESA’s mission control in Darmstadt, teams faced a scenario unlike any before: a solar storm of extreme magnitude. Fortunately, this nightmare unfolded not in reality, but as part of the simulation campaign for Sentinel-1D, pushing the boundaries of spacecraft operations and space weather preparedness.",

    "detailed_news": "ESA simulation campaign for Sentinel-1D, scheduled for launch on 4 November 2025. The exercise replicated the effects of a catastrophic solar storm on satellite operations to test the team’s ability to respond without satellite navigation and under severe electronic disruption. The simulation team has modelled a massive, X45-class flare, with intense X-ray and ultraviolet radiation disrupting radar systems, communications, and tracking data. An event of such magnitude would severely degrade the quality of conjunction data. Single-event upsets became even more frequent, impairing systems and shortening operational life. GNSS signals degraded further, star trackers went blind and battery charging events added to the chaos. The simulation will provide critical insights for the constitution of European-wide space weather operational services."
