    "detailed_news": " Artemis II crew members announced the name they have chosen for their Orion capsule — Integrity. The goal is to fly around the Moon, but the spacecraft and life support systems first must pass tests in Earth orbit before NASA decides to execute the Trans-Lunar Injection (TLI) burn. The crew said today enabling Artemis III is their measure of success. Space weather is caused by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from the Sun. CMEs create breathtaking auroras on Earth, but also can disrupt electrical systems and orbiting satellites. Artemis II crew can shelter in Orion’s storage compartments if there is a CME during their 10-day flight."

IMAP will fly to the Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 1 (L1), which is located between the Sun and our planet, approximately 1.5 million km away from Earth. IMAP is expected to answer four critical questions that have plagued heliophysics for decades. IMAP is relatively small, massing 900 kg and measuring just 2.4 m in diameter and 0.9 m in height. Despite this small size, IMAP’s engineers and scientists implemented 10 scientific instruments on the spacecraft. NOAA’s SWFO-L1 spacecraft is joining IMAP on its journey to L1. The observatory is the first satellite to be dedicated to continuous, operational space weather observations. The Carruthers Geocorona Observatory will investigate the geoc orona, Earth's outermost atmosphere.  NASASpaceflight.com will be taking part in the 25th anniversary of the space shuttle program. The program will take place between September 22, 2025 and April 11, 2025. The first shuttle mission will take off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on September 22. The mission will be followed by a series of other flights over the next few years."

The Jielong 3 rocket is capable of flying up to 1,600 kg to a 500 km altitude. The rocket will carry the Jili (Geely) Constellation 06 satellites A through K. The Geely communications satellite constellation is designed to offer coverage for the Internet of Things. The IMAP spacecraft will study the boundary between the heliosphere and interstellar space. The United Launch Alliance has scheduled its third Atlas V flight of the year for Thursday, Sept. 25. Amazon is racing to launch as many Kuiper satellites as possible before a July 2026 deadline. China is planning to fly a Chang Zheng 2D (CZ-2D) on Friday, September 26, at 17:20 UTC. The third Starlink launch of this week is scheduled for Sunday, Sept. 28 at 3:30 AM EDT (07:30 UTC) from SLC-40 at the CCSFS. The rocket will take a northeast trajectory and will fly a batch of Starlink v2 Mini satellites to low-Earth orbit inclined 53.16 degrees to the Equator.
