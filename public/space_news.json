Ship 38 and Booster 15-2 are the last Block 2 Starship vehicles to fly. Ship 37 redeemed Block 2 of the ship with a very successful mission on Flight 10. The mission objectives for this mission are unchanged from the last four flights, except for an extra test goal for the ship and booster. SpaceX is targeting Oct 13, at 6:15 pm CDT for the 11th flight of Starship. The weather currently looks excellent for launch, with a high of 87°F and low winds. This flight will be bittersweet as Pad 1(A) will be used for the last time in this configuration."

    "detailed_news": "NASA’s Cassini mission extensively studied Saturn and its moons from 2004 to 2017. In 2005, it revealed large geyser-like jets extending from Enceladus’ south pole. Later studies would suggest that a massive subsurface ocean was responsible for the jets. Now, in a new study using archival Cassini data, a team of scientists has discovered a plethora of new complex organic molecules within these jets. The speed at which the ice grains impacted the CDA proved to be important in Khawaja et al.’s analysis. “The ice grains contain not just frozen water, but also other molecules, including organics. At lower impact speeds, the ice shatters, and the signal from clusters of water molecules can hide the signals from certain organic molecules,” says Khwaja."

Progress, Cargo Dragon, and Cygnus spacecraft continue to fly vital missions to keep humanity’s presence in low-Earth orbit going. Japan is also readying its HTV-X cargo spacecraft for its first flight this month. Sierra Space's Dream Chaser, however, is no longer targeted to fly to ISS on its first demonstration mission. The Cygnus XL S.S. launched atop a Falcon 9 from SLC-40 at CCSFS on Sept. 14. This was the first flight of the CygnUS XL version of Northrop Grumman’s cargo spacecraft, featuring an eight-meter-long cargo module. NG-23 carried 5,000 kg of cargo to the Station, including a variety of experiments, as well as the usual selection of hardware and consumables. The HTV-X spacecraft is scheduled to fly on Oct. 20 atop a H3-24L rocket from the Tanegashima Space Center. The spacecraft offers the ability to carry large items of unpressurized cargo that other cargo ships would not be able to fly to the Station. The next launch to the ISS will be the Soyuz MS-28 crewed mission, which is currently set for Nov. 27.  NASASpaceflight.com will take part in the 25th anniversary of NASA's space shuttle program. The program will take place over the course of the next 15 years, starting in 2025 and ending in 2025. NASA will be taking part in a number of events during that time, including a spacewalk."

Their catalogue is the first ever to include the speeds and directions of motions for dust devils all over Mars. By tracking how fast the dust devils moved, the researchers found wind speeds of up to 44 m/s. This is faster than we’ve ever measured with rovers on the ground – though it’s worth noting that the martian air is so thin that a human would barely even notice a wind of 100 km/h on Mars. Until now, our models of Mars’s climate have been based on the limited data we have from missions that don’t really cover much of the surface. Thanks to this study, we now have lots of new measurements from all over Mars. This improves our understanding and predictions of wind patterns around the Red Planet."

    "detailed_news": "Blue Origin is one step closer to its second ever launch of its New Glenn rocket. The booster, named ‘Never Tell Me the Odds,’ a nod to the famous line from Star Wars , will be used during the upcoming launch of NASA’s Mars-bound Escape and Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers ( EscaPADE ) mission. A specific date for that hasn’t been announced, but it's likely in early November. Blue Origin scrubbed the planned launch Tuesday of the company’s suborbital New Shepard booster from West Texas due to a “ground infrastructure issue,” and later said the flight would be pushed back to early 2019. SpaceX and ULA would launch five and two missions respectively as part of the latest round of National Security Space Launch contract assignments."
