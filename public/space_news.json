Northrop Grumman and SpaceX are the two U.S. companies currently delivering cargo to the ISS as part of the Commercial Resupplies Services 2 contract with NASA. The SpX-33 mission, also referred to as CRS-33, successfully launched from pad 40 at Cape Canaveral on Aug. 24 and autonomously docked to the space station less than 29 hours later. The next cargo mission on the schedule is another new spacecraft called the HTV-X."
