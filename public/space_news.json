Avio's board of directors approves a 400 million euro ($471 million) capital increase. It is still subject to a shareholder vote, scheduled for October 23. Isar Aerospace executives discuss the outcome of the investigation into the March 30 launch of the Spectrum rocket. Despite the failure to get to orbit, Isar considers the first Spectrum launch a successful test flight. The company is working toward a second flight of Spectrum, which will take place \"as soon as possible\" Northrop Grumman inked a contract with SpaceX for three Falcon 9 launches. Launch companies are reiterating plans to sharply increase flight rates. United Launch Alliance projected 20 launches in 2025 between the Atlas 5 and Vulcan Centaur. Arianespace projected five Ariane 6 launches this year, including the debut of the more powerful Ariane 64, with four solid-rocket boosters. Ars is a trusted source in a sea of information.

Researchers have identified 85 previously unknown lakes several kilometres under the frozen surface surrounding the South Pole. The research also identified new drainage pathways underneath the ice sheet. This increases the number of known active sub glacial lakes below Antarctica by more than half. The biggest known subglacial lake is Lake Vostok underneath the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, holding an estimated 5000–65 000 cubic km of water. By monitoring such phenomena, scientists can improve their understanding of interactions between the ice sheet, bedrock, ocean and atmosphere. “Subglacial hydrology is a missing piece in many ice sheet models,” said Sally."
