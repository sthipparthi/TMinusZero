NASA and Lockheed are working on a plan to reuse components of the Orion spacecraft. The plan calls for a step-by-step approach. Lockheed will never achieve \"full and rapid reusability\" for Orion like SpaceX is attempting with its Starship vehicle. But Orion is here and ready for its first astronauts in 2026.

All 33 engines were running at liftoff, and unlike Flight 10, no engines shut off during the ascent. With the boost back complete, and for the final time, Booster 15-2 separated its hotstage ring to let it fall into the gulf. Super Heavy Booster 15-2 was down-selected from 13 engines to five engines, then down to three. This landing burn profile will enable more redundancy during the final adjustment phase of the landing burn, and allowing the booster to exert greater control over its trajectory. The booster entered a hover above the Gulf before shutting off all its engines, dropping into the water, and exploding. The day after launch, SpaceX released drone footage of the belly flop and landing. Flight 11 was a perfect send-off for Blocks 1 and 2 and for Pad 1 as SpaceX ends flight tests this year on a high note. Next up is Block 3, Raptor 3, and Pad 2(B) with Booster 18 and Ship 39. It is unclear when these vehicles will be ready for single-vehicle testing and eventually full-stack testing."

The simulation team has modelled a massive, X45-class flare, with intense X-ray and ultraviolet radiation disrupting radar systems, communications, and tracking data. An event of such magnitude would severely degrade the quality of conjunction data. Single-event upsets became even more frequent, impairing systems and shortening operational life. GNSS signals degraded further, star trackers went blind and battery charging events added to the chaos. The simulation will provide critical insights for the constitution of European-wide space weather operational services."

SpaceX is set to continue its impressive launch cadence with six Falcon 9 missions in one week. China now has four launches planned for the week, and Rocket Lab successfully launched an Electron from New Zealand on Tuesday. Falcon 9 launched a new batch of internet satellites on Monday for Amazon’s Project Kuiper constellation. The KF-03 mission launched on Oct. 13 at 9:58 PM EDT (Tuesday, 01:58 UTC), with 24 communication satellites flying on a northeast trajectory into low-Earth orbit. This mission had suffered considerable delays due to the unsuitable weather conditions in Florida last week. Falcon 9 is set to launch the Starship Group 10-52 mission on Thursday, Oct. 16, at 2:42 AM EDT (06:42 UTC) from SLC-40 at the CCSFS in Florida. Falcon 9 will carry 21 satellites on a due south trajectory toward a polar orbit. Supporting this flight is booster B1093, which will be flying for the seventh time. The booster will land atop SpaceX’s west coast droneship Of Course I Still Love You. The final Falcon 9 launch of the week is scheduled for Monday, Oct. 20, at 7:00 AM PDT (14:00 UTC) from SLC-4E in California. Booster B1075 will deliver a further 28 v2 Mini Starlink satellites into the constellation’s Group 11 shell for the Starlink Group 11-5 mission. The booster first flew on June 3, 2021."

    "detailed_news": "Earth’s magnetic field is vital to life on our planet. It is largely generated by a global ocean of molten, swirling liquid iron that makes up the outer core around 3000 km beneath our feet. The weak field South Atlantic Anomaly was first identified southeast of South America back in the 19th century. Earth’s magnetic field strengthens over Siberia. Magnetic field over Siberia has strengthened while it has weakened over Canada. This shift is associated with the northern magnetic pole moving towards Siberia in recent years. The shift is important for navigation, which is affected by the dance between these two areas of strong magnetic field."

SpaceX will reuse 24 out of the 33 Raptor 2 engines on B15 during the Flight 11 mission. A commercial lunar lander built by Astrobotic will launch from the Kennedy Space Center on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket in late 2023. Two South Korean Earth-watching satellites will ride Ariane 5 rockets into orbit in 2018 and 2019. Arianespace beat SpaceX in a competition to launch the spacecraft."
