Shenzhou 20 is China's second mission to the Tiangong 1 space station. The CZ-2F rocket has the capacity to lift 8,400 kg to low-Earth orbit. The Shenzhou spacecraft has a larger internal habitable volume than the Soyuz spacecraft, and is similarly limited to three crew. Shenzhou-20 crew will return to Earth in early November. Crew may even exceed the longest single-mission stay of 192 days, set by Shenzhou-18 in 2024. Commander Chen Dong is the first taikonaut to spend over 400 days in space. The new crew will spend around six months on the station."

Canada used to have a Manitoba spaceport when the United States was in a “space race” for military supremacy in the 1950s and 1960s. Japan's HTV-X cargo ship pulled alongside the International Space Station on Wednesday. India seeks to dramatically scale up its annual launch cadence to 50 missions a year. ArianeGroup will transfer responsibility for the assembly of Ariane 6 Vinci upper-stage engines from France to Germany. The number 135 is equal to the number of NASA’s space shuttles over the 30-year lifetime of the program. The mission came nearly a week after SpaceX launched its 10,000th Starlink satellite to date.

The former NASA Administrators called on the space agency to rethink its plans to land astronauts on the Moon using SpaceX's Starship. They said development of the revolutionary vehicle was taking too long and required unnecessary complexity. Bridenstine argued that the current architecture using Starship for Artemis 3 crewed landing means that the “probability of beating China approaches zero rapidly” He suggested a more Apollo-style route of launching both Orion and the lander on one flight of the SLS rocket equipped with the Exploration Upper Stage being built by Boeing. Liftoff came on the heels of leaders from the U.S. Space Force gathering to discuss how to adjust to a rapidly increasing launch cadence for both the Eastern Range and Western Range. “Since it’s definitely a competitive environment, I probably won’t say too much about it, but we did just kick off that work with NASA,” Cortese said."

Astronauts use the EMUs whenever they leave the airlock to perform upgrades, major installations, repairs, and other maintenance tasks that need to be performed by an astronaut. The EMU is out of production, and the suits are aging, with issues forcing cancellations and delays of some recent spacewalks. The EMU's usage will likely end with the Station’s decommissioning in the 2030-2031 timeframe if it is not replaced earlier. Collins Aerospace was awarded the $324 million cost-plus-award-fee Extravehicular Activity Space Operations Contract in 2010. In June 2024, NASA astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson’s spacesuit experienced water leak in a service and cooling umbilical unit. The leak forced her and Michael Barratt to abort EVA-90 before they could perform any tasks. Spacewalks from the USOS resumed in January 2025 after replacement of the faulty unit. Collins Aerospace was contracted to develop a new spacesuit for low-Earth orbit. Collins terminated its effort to develop the replacement ISS suit in June 2024. Axiom Space is now the sole contractor working on next-generation spacesuits for NASA. In August, Axiom announced that it had completed 700 hours of testing on the suit. The spacesuit is another key part of Artemis that must be ready before Artemis III can land on the lunar surface. Another risk the GAO report identified was the reliance on a sole contractor, much like NASA’s reliance on Collins Aerospace for the EMU. Artemis III is officially scheduled to fly no earlier than the middle of 2027."

The winning teams – TelePIX from the Republic of Korea, Datalayer from Belgium, DisasterM3 from Japan and Thales Services Numériques from France – were honoured recently during a ceremony held at the Charter’s 54th Board Meeting in Strasbourg. The competition was organised by the European Space Agency in collaboration with the International Charter ‘Space and Major Disasters’ The European finalists stood out for their cutting-edge approaches. Participants faced challenges similar to real-world emergency operations. Datalayer leveraged scalable, cloud-based machine learning pipelines. Thales Services Numériques applied deep-learning and trustworthy-AI techniques to pinpoint structural damage with precision."
