    "detailed_news": "The European Space Agency’s Gaia mission has revealed the nature, history, and behaviour of billions of stars. Since it opened its eyes in 2014, Gaia has mapped how different stars zip through space and pinpointed their whereabouts more precisely than ever. The telescope has watched whether they shrink and swell, spotted surprising ‘ starquakes ’, monitored how stars grow, evolve, and crystallise as they die. Gaia has revolutionised our view of the solar neighbourhood, allowing scientists to comprehensively map all the stars and interstellar ‘stuff’ near the Sun in a way they were unable to do before. Scientists have also applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) to Gaia data, using algorithms and machine learning approaches to pinpoint new cluster members and subgroups of stars. In this way, Gaia has pushed us to rethink how we hunt for stellar groups.  Gaia has shown that structures resembling streams, beads, strings, pearls, snakes, rings, or filaments of stars are reasonably common in young cluster formation. It has also revealed that large-scale galactic dynamics influence how young star clusters form in the first place. Thanks to Gaia, open clusters are no longer seen as isolated entities but as dynamically evolving structures, slowly dissolving into our galaxy. Gaia has now completed its sky-scanning observations and, as of March 2025, is quietly orbiting the Sun in its retirement orbit. The vast majority of data collected by the spacecraft is yet to be released, with a couple of huge data releases planned by the end of the decade. Scientists are already using Gaia’s treasure trove of released observations to explore billions of stars and objects in our galaxy and beyond."

HLS data are available for download on NASA Earthdata: HLSL30v3.0 and HLSS30v4.0 . HLS V2.0 provides data at a spatial resolution of 30 m (98 ft) with near-global coverage from 2013 onward. HLS V1.4 covered about 30% of the global land area, providing data on North America and other select locations. The increased frequency of observations improved the ability of the scientific community to track disaster recovery. On average, DIST-ALERT is made available on LP DAAC within six hours of when new HLS data is available. Currently, the dataset does not provide attribution to disturbances. HLS V2.0 data are also better at identifying disturbances in cloudy ecosystems than other individual alert systems."

This journey started with Ship 33 and Booster 14 for Flight 7 on January 16, 2025. The second Block 2 ship to fly was Ship 34 paired with Booster 15. Ship 36 experienced an anomaly on June 18, which resulted in the loss of the ship on the Masseys static fire test stand. This caused a pressurization problem in the payload bay and in the methane tank. Ship 35 reentered in an uncontrolled manner and was lost without completing any primary objectives. Booster 16 was static fire tested on June 6, when it was slated to fly with Ship 36.  Starship Flight 10 is currently set for no earlier than Aug 24 at 6:30 pm Central Daylight Time with a one-hour launch window. The only significant difference is that Booster 16 will have a boost back burn that is 10 seconds longer compared to Flight 9.

    "summary": "Asteroid Bennu, sampled by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission in 2023, is a mixture of dust that formed in our solar system, organic matter from interstellar space, and pre-solar system stardust. Its unique and varied contents were dramatically transformed over time by interactions with water and exposure to the harsh space environment. These insights come from a trio of newly published papers based on the analysis of Bennu samples by scientists at NASA and other institutions.",

Some types of asteroids burn up in the atmosphere and never make it to the ground. The next samples NASA expects to help unravel our solar system's story will be Moon rocks returned by the Artemis III astronauts."

    "summary": "The Lunar Environment Structural Test Rig simulates the intense cold of the lunar night, ranging from 40 Kelvin (K) to 125 K while maintaining a vacuum environment. This creates a tool by which scientists and engineers can test materials, electronics, and flight hardware for future Moon and Mars missions, characterizing their behaviors at these temperatures while also validating their ability to meet design requirements.",
