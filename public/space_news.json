The former NASA Administrators called on the space agency to rethink its plans to land astronauts on the Moon using SpaceX's Starship. They said development of the revolutionary vehicle was taking too long and required unnecessary complexity. Bridenstine argued that the current architecture using Starship for Artemis 3 crewed landing means that the “probability of beating China approaches zero rapidly” He suggested a more Apollo-style route of launching both Orion and the lander on one flight of the SLS rocket equipped with the Exploration Upper Stage being built by Boeing. Liftoff came on the heels of leaders from the U.S. Space Force gathering to discuss how to adjust to a rapidly increasing launch cadence for both the Eastern Range and Western Range. “Since it’s definitely a competitive environment, I probably won’t say too much about it, but we did just kick off that work with NASA,” Cortese said."

    "detailed_news": "The Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU), the long-serving Shuttle-era spacesuit, is currently used aboard the International Space Station for all EVAs. Astronauts use the EMUs whenever they leave the airlock to perform upgrades, major installations, repairs, and other maintenance tasks that need to be performed by an astronaut. The EMU is out of production, and the suits are aging, with issues forcing cancellations and delays of some recent spacewalks. The EMU's usage will likely end with the Station’s decommissioning in the 2030-2031 timeframe if it is not replaced earlier. Collins Aerospace was awarded the $324 million cost-plus-award-fee Extravehicular Activity Space Operations Contract in 2010. In June 2024, NASA astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson’s spacesuit experienced water leak in a service and cooling umbilical unit. The leak forced her and Michael Barratt to abort EVA-90 before they could perform any tasks. Spacewalks from the USOS resumed in January 2025 after replacement of the faulty unit. Collins Aerospace was contracted to develop a new spacesuit for low-Earth orbit. Collins terminated its effort to develop the replacement ISS suit in June 2024. Axiom Space is now the sole contractor working on next-generation spacesuits for NASA. In August, Axiom announced that it had completed 700 hours of testing on the suit. The spacesuit is another key part of Artemis that must be ready before Artemis III can land on the lunar surface. Another risk the GAO report identified was the reliance on a sole contractor, much like NASA’s reliance on Collins Aerospace for the EMU. Artemis III is officially scheduled to fly no earlier than the middle of 2027."

Henon is expected to piggyback on the launch of a larger spacecraft planned for late 2026. The launcher will take the CubeSat 1.5 million km beyond Earth in the direction away from the Sun. The Henon mission is being developed with funding from ESA’s General Support Technology Programme (GSTP) The CubeSat will use its new electric propulsion system to fly to a Distant Retrograde Orbit (DRO) around the Sun. Henon will be the first ever spacecraft to fly in this type of orbit, which will take it 12 million km from Earth at its closest point, and 24 million km away at the farthest."

Blue Origin plans to recover the first stage booster flying on the upcoming EscaPADE mission for NASA and then reuse it for the first flight of a Blue Moon Mk. 1 lander. Last month, NASA tapped Blue Origin as the vehicle that will deliver its VIPER (Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover) mission to the Moon. SpaceX was granted a $2.89 billion contract for the Artemis 3 mission in April 2021. The company completed 11 integrated test flights of its Starship-Super Heavy rocket and is preparing to transition to the third major version of the launch vehicle.

The demolition efforts started with the iconic “chopsticks’ of the “Mechazilla system” – the massive mechanical arms on the launch tower used for catching and stacking boosters and ships. The Orbital Launch Mount (OLM) at Pad 1 will be the most visually prominent element of deconstruction. Work is already underway, removing several of the internal components such as piping, wiring, valves, and other components. Demolition extends to the tank farm, where Pad 1’s outdated subcoolers, pumps, and auxiliary hardware are being dismantled."

After ballooning into cool red giants, these stars shed their outer layers and cast them into space. Ultraviolet light from the central star ionises the cast-off material, causing it to glow."
