NASA wants commercial companies to step forward with commercial space stations where NASA can be just one of many customers. At other events this week, representatives from those companies will be sharing their plans. It’s day 33 of the partial government shutdown. House Speaker Mike Johnson decided on Friday to keep the House out of legislative session for yet another week. The shutdown can only end if enough Senate Democrats/Independents decide to vote with most Republicans. There are quite a few interesting events here and overseas. There are lots of great meetings and conferences on tap this week. We highlight a few names that probably are familiar to the readers of this website. There does not appear to be a virtual option. Check back throughout the week for others we learn about later and add to our Calendar."

The 45th Weather Squadron forecast a 95 percent chance for favorable weather at liftoff with just a small chance for interference from cumulus clouds. Starcloud believes that its future space-based data centers can be “ten times cheaper than land-based options” Philip Johnston predicted that “In 10 years, nearly all new data centers will be being built in outer space” Germany-based Exolaunch is responsible for manifesting and deploying 13 out of the 18 payloads flying."
