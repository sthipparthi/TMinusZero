As NASA prepares for Artemis missions to the Moon and sets sights on Mars, the space station continues to enable groundbreaking research not possible on Earth. The space station provides a testbed to refine these systems before human’s travel to distant destinations. Astronauts aboard the space station have collected photographs to document Earth’s surface through Crew Earth Observations. Now, those same techniques are being adapted for Artemis II , where astronauts will use handheld cameras to capture images of the Moon. Researchers have also advanced 3D printing in space , enabling astronauts to make tools and parts on-demand. Measurements taken on Artemis II crew will expand a repository of human health data. NASA researchers hope to use this data repository to develop protocols aimed at keeping astronauts healthy on missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Organ-chip research could improve crew prevention measures and create personalized medical treatments for humans, on Earth and in space."

The SWIM sensor can also be manufactured with a lightweight carbon-composite cover (or the cover can be omitted) to achieve a sensor mass of ~110 g. Using three smaller cores with improved metallurgy instead of six large racetrack cores reduced the power consumption by a factor of two. The MAGIC electronics use a traditional analog demodulator fluxgate and magnetic feedback design."

The pad is set to host its first launch during Flight 12 of Starship in 2026. Pad 2 at Starbase is ramping up its testing ahead of hosting the next version of Starship, starting with Flight 12 next year. A key advantage over Pad 1 is the potential for same-day retests following an abort. Pad 2’s setup allows for quicker recovery and retry once the issue is resolved. The “Megabunker’ has emerged at the old launch site entrance. It resembles a fortified medieval fortress, sparking speculation about its purpose. Experts suggest it may house critical electronics and control equipment for pad operations. The next step involves fitting flex hoses to link the quick disconnects to ground systems."

And now it has become clear that a great wave stirs the motion of stars in our galaxy over distances of tens of thousands of light-years from the Sun. ‘This observed behaviour is consistent with what we would expect from a wave,’ says Eloisa Poggio from INAF in Italy. Young giant stars and Cepheids move with the wave. It is possible that young stars retain the memory of the wave information from the gas itself, from which they were born. Scientists do not know the origin of these galactic shakes. A past collision with a dwarf galaxy could be a possible explanation."

If nothing changes, agencies like NASA will have to pause all non-essential operations at 12:01 am Wednesday after FY2025 ends with no appropriations for FY2026. House Republicans passed a “clean” Continuing Resolution (CR) on September 19 to keep the government operating at full strength through November 21. The House can pass legislation with a simple majority, but the Senate needs 60 votes to pass this type of bill. Shutdowns are caused by a lapse in appropriations and impact activities funded in the 12 appropriations bills. During a shutdown, essential operations including those to protect life and property continue, although workers are not paid until the shutdown ends. At NASA, operations of the International Space Station, for example, will not be affected."

Onboard will be 28 more Starlink v2 Mini satellites, bound for an orbit at an altitude of 595 km, inclined at 53 degrees. Booster B1097 will make its second flight, having debuted only weeks ago at the start of September, launching a mission for Starlink's Group 17 shell.

Our Solar System contains eight major planets, and more than 400 known moons orbiting six of these planets. In the coming year, the team will use Webb to perform a comprehensive survey of similar objects to better understand the diversity of physical and chemical properties in the discs around young planets. The insights could be useful as our Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ( Juice ) makes its way to Jupiter, and as we prepare a future mission to orbit and land on Saturn's moon Enceladus."

Cosmic Shielding is currently based in Atlanta but plans to relocate to Huntsville, Alabama.

The white dwarf observed by Hubble is about the size of Earth but much heavier, at around half the mass of our Sun. The white dwarf was likely once a Sun-like star that hosted a suite of planets and circumstellar disks similar to the Kuiper Belt.
