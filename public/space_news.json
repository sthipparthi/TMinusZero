The Henon mission is being developed with funding from ESA’s General Support Technology Programme (GSTP) The CubeSat will use its new electric propulsion system to fly to a Distant Retrograde Orbit (DRO) around the Sun. Henon will be the first ever spacecraft to fly in this type of orbit, which will take it 12 million km from Earth at its closest point, and 24 million km away at the farthest."

Blue Origin plans to recover the first stage booster flying on the upcoming EscaPADE mission for NASA and then reuse it for the first flight of a Blue Moon Mk. 1 lander. Last month, NASA tapped Blue Origin as the vehicle that will deliver its VIPER (Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover) mission to the Moon. SpaceX was granted a $2.89 billion contract for the Artemis 3 mission in April 2021. The company completed 11 integrated test flights of its Starship-Super Heavy rocket and is preparing to transition to the third major version of the launch vehicle.

The demolition efforts started with the iconic “chopsticks’ of the “Mechazilla system” – the massive mechanical arms on the launch tower used for catching and stacking boosters and ships. The Orbital Launch Mount (OLM) at Pad 1 will be the most visually prominent element of deconstruction. Work is already underway, removing several of the internal components such as piping, wiring, valves, and other components. Demolition extends to the tank farm, where Pad 1’s outdated subcoolers, pumps, and auxiliary hardware are being dismantled."

The mount itself was built at the production site, then rolled to the launch site and installed on the legs on July 31, 2021. Pad 1 propelled the Starship program through the early years and now moves towards the new phase of operations. The booster test stand turned launch mount has reached the end of its life. The first-ever static fire on Pad 1 occurred on Aug 9, 2022, with a single engine test from Booster 7. The first stack of the first set of actual flight vehicles occurred on Oct 11, 2022. A Wet Dress Rehearsal was completed with Booster 7 and Ship 24 on Jan 23, 2023. A full-duration 10-second 33 engine static fire wouldn’t occur until Aug 25, 20 23, with Booster 9. Pad 1 performed 28 cryogenic proof and tanking tests, 15 spin primes, 34 static fires, six wet dress rehearsals, four aborted launch attempts, and 11 Full Stack flight tests. The quickest turnaround time for Pad 1 was 37 days between Flight 5 and Flight 6."
