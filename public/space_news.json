If not, China will soon reach parity and potentially move ahead, hence the decision to name the report."

    "detailed_news": "Northrop Grumman’s first Cygnus XL vehicle was jettisoned on its way to the International Space Station following a pre-sunset launch from Cape Canaveral Sunday evening. The cargo vehicle is scheduled to be berthed to the ISS by NASA astronaut Jonny Kim on Wednesday, Sept. 17. This was just the fourth flight for this booster with the tail number B1094. A follow up experiment will look at how to manage a zero boil off situation for propellant storage tanks in low Earth orbit. Bristol Myers Squibb will also be conducting a crystal growth experiment using Redwire Space’s Pharmaceutical In-space Laboratory. The launch of the NG-23 mission came months earlier than was originally scheduled. The Starlink 6-67 mission will fly on a south-easterly trajectory once it departs from pad 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Liftoff is targeting 12:38 p.m. EDT (1638 UTC) on May 14. The three newest residents of the International Space Station sped into orbit Wednesday aboard a Soyuz launcher."
