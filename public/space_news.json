The challenge is designed to accelerate technologies that will help humankind live and work sustainably on the Moon. Last week, eight teams demonstrated robotic systems capable of collecting and processing lunar soil. The winning team is expected to be announced at the end of November. Team ASTROLITH developed Kirb-e, a robotic system built for Moon-like conditions designed to dig and sort lunar soil. Using a rover equipped with rotating shovels, the team successfully collected and processed large quantities of regolith simulant. The material was then funneled into a rotary sieve to separate it by particle size. The rover collects lunar soil using a rotating tube, which also acts as the internal storage in which it remains. To reduce the risk of dust interfering with moving parts, they sealed the chassis and minimised exposed mechanisms. Although they faced challenges with motor drivers and software integration, the team was proud to complete and test their system."

FutureEO will be structured around three pillars: Foundations, Missions and Data, and Earth Action. The Foundations pillar is the engine that powers every future Earth observation mission. It lays the groundwork for science, technology and mission preparation. The Earth Action pillar turns Earth observation into real-world impact, delivering benefits for science and society. The Next Generation Gravity Mission will provide unmatched insight into how ‘mass’ moves within the Earth system. WIVERN is the eleventh mission to be selected for implementation as an Earth Explorer. The Climate Change Initiative , EO for Society and the Global Development Assistance element will now be integrated into Earth Action."

The thrust structure for Terran R’s second flight is now under construction, along with critical avionics for the first flight. All eight structural barrels of the first stage were welded by the end of August, and the company has started welding them together to form the first-stage body. The two structural barrels for the second stage were finished in August as well. The 82 m tall Terran R is scheduled to launch in the second half of 2026. The partially reusable vehicle is designed to compete with other partially reusable vehicles like Falcon 9 and Neutron. Terran R’s first stage will land on an automated landing ship downrange after launch."

NASA administrator Sean Duffy said he was reworking the agency’s lunar lander contracts because SpaceX had fallen behind. Duffy sought to demonstrate to the rest of the space community that he was willing to stand up to SpaceX. Musk channeled his inner Trump and called out ‘Sean Dummy’ A fierce, behind-the-scenes battle rages on among camps supporting Duffy and Isaacman to decide the leadership of NASA.

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk downplayed the urgency of beating China, advocating instead for long-term sustainability.

    "detailed_news": "Viasat plans to commercialise its new in-flight connectivity solution called Viasat Amara. It has a dual-beam phased array antenna that provides both better access to video calling (a latency-sensitive use), as well as video streaming such as watching a football match. This is possible because the antenna can connect to satellites both in low Earth orbit and in geostationary orbit, depending on what is needed."

Despite being preliminary, these images mark a major milestone in Europe’s ability to monitor air quality all the way from geostationary orbit, 36 000 kilometres above Earth. Ozone high up in the stratosphere plays a crucial role in shielding life on Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. But ozone in the lower atmosphere acts as a pollutant, contributing to poor air quality and respiratory problems. Overall ozone levels here are within the expected range. The large-scale distribution, featuring a maximum over the Balkans and Greece and a minimum over the Baltic region, is consistent with patterns detected on the same day."
