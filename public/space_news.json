Both satellites have an altimeter instrument that measures sea levels, wind speeds, and wave heights, among other characteristics. Sentinel-6B will extend a long-term dataset featuring more than 30 years of sea level measurements. The dataset has turned this dataset into the gold standard sea level measurement from space. “This kind of data can’t be easily replaced,” said Mehra."

Saliva provides a unique window into how the human immune system functions in a deep space environment. AVATAR could inform measures to ensure crew health on future deep space missions, including personalizing medical kits to each astronaut. The Artemis II crew will take advantage of their location to explore the Moon from above. As the first humans to see the lunar surface up close since 1972, they’ll document their observations through photographs and audio recordings. Artemis II will be the first mission to integrate science flight control operations. The crew will be equipped with questions that scientists didn’t even know to ask during Apollo missions. Lessons learned during Artemis II will pave the way for lunar science operations on future missions. Several additional experiments are hitching a ride to space onboard Artemis II in the form of CubeSats – shoe-box-sized technology demonstrations."

How to do Mars Sample Return more cost effectively and on a shorter time frame remains unclear. Eight companies replied to NASA’s request for ideas last year, but none were sufficient for NASA to make a decision before the change in administrations. Earlier problems and budget uncertainty forced JPL to lay off 13 percent of its workforce in 2024."

    "detailed_news": "An international team of scientists has revealed that unusual leopard-spot patterns on a Martian rock may hold clues to ancient microbial life on the Red Planet. The rock, dubbed Cheyava Falls, was discovered by NASA’s Perseverance rover in June 2024 within the ancient river valley of Neretva Vallis. Cheyava Falls is among the youngest sedimentary rocks analyzed by Perseverance. This challenges earlier assumptions that biosignatures would only survive in formations far older than those currently known. This has reignited discussions about NASA’s Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission, which aims to bring Martian rocks back to Earth."

NISAR will use two different radar frequencies to penetrate clouds and forest canopies. Combining data from these two radars will allow researchers to systematically and globally map Earth. The radar reflector will be used to direct and receive microwave signals from the two radars. By interpreting the differences between the L-band and S-band measurements, researchers will be able to discern characteristics about the surface below. As NISAR passes over the same locations twice every 12 days, scientists can evaluate how those characteristics have changed over time. The OCO mission hasn’t just about been about data and hardware. The human stories woven through the mission’s successes and setbacks are really what holds the mission together. OCO-3 extends the global CO 2 measurement record while adding new capabilities made possible by being on ISS. GEDI’s lasers have been operating nominally and the mission has continued to produce high-quality observations.

ABoVE deployed in three phases: 1) ecosystem dynamics (2015–2018); 2) ecosystem services (2017–2022); and 3) analysis and synthesis (2023–present) Now in the last year of the third phase, the Science Team (ST) consists of 67 active NASA-funded projects. Leads for the thematic working groups (WG) presented synthetic overviews of the research efforts of their group members. Following these presentations, breakout groups convened to discuss future activities of the WGs. Short summaries of each presentation are available below. Goetz reviewed the meeting goals and objectives. The Hydrology–Permafrost–Wetlands WG focused on the processes controlling changes in permafrost distribution and properties. The Disturbance Working Group WG leads presented their decade-long perspective on disturbance-related research in the ABoVE domain. ASTM11 participants watched the film, “ Scotty Creek Research Community - The Spirit of Collaboration ,” about the SCRS. ABoVE participated in multiple strategies to communicate research results to the public. ABoVE continued collaborating through knowledge exchange with early-career researchers and interns. ASTM11 featured 41 research posters across three sessions, organized by thematic area. Table 1 below provides all the project titles, presenter names, and links to each project and presentation. The UAF Arctic Research Open House was an opportunity for ST members and the public to explore the wide range of research happening at UAF. Many of the ABoVE collaborators were able to present at ASTM11. The UAF Alaska Fire Science Consortium, Bureau of Land Management Alaska Fire Service, and local artist Klara Maisch collaborated to develop the Wildfire Walk. A series of presentations on the overall structure and outcomes of ABoVE were held during ASTM11. Ryan Pavlick provided details on the NISAR mission, which launched after the meeting on July 30, 2025. A Career Trajectory panel featured Jennifer Watts, Jonathan Wang, Brendan Rogers, and Xiaoran “Seamore” Zhu. Klara Maisch discussed her work creating science-informed artwork through interdisciplinary collaborations.  ASTM11 brought together an interdisciplinary team for a final team meeting that showcased the many accomplishments made over the past decade. The group outlined current gaps and needs in Arctic and boreal research and discussed possibilities for future NASA terrestrial ecology campaigns. While this was the last meeting of this ST, research for some projects will continue into 2026."

An earlier hypothesis assumed signs of ancient life would be confined to older rock formations. This finding suggests that Mars could have been habitable for a longer period or later in the planet’s history than previously thought."
