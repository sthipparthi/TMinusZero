Super Heavy Booster 15-2 was down-selected from 13 engines to five engines, then down to three. This landing burn profile will enable more redundancy during the final adjustment phase of the landing burn, and allowing the booster to exert greater control over its trajectory. The booster entered a hover above the Gulf before shutting off all its engines, dropping into the water, and exploding. The day after launch, SpaceX released drone footage of the belly flop and landing. Flight 11 was a perfect send-off for Blocks 1 and 2 and for Pad 1 as SpaceX ends flight tests this year on a high note. Next up is Block 3, Raptor 3, and Pad 2(B) with Booster 18 and Ship 39. It is unclear when these vehicles will be ready for single-vehicle testing and eventually full-stack testing."

The simulation team has modelled a massive, X45-class flare, with intense X-ray and ultraviolet radiation disrupting radar systems, communications, and tracking data. An event of such magnitude would severely degrade the quality of conjunction data. Single-event upsets became even more frequent, impairing systems and shortening operational life. GNSS signals degraded further, star trackers went blind and battery charging events added to the chaos. The simulation will provide critical insights for the constitution of European-wide space weather operational services."

This mission had suffered considerable delays due to the unsuitable weather conditions in Florida last week. Falcon 9 is set to launch the Starship Group 10-52 mission on Thursday, Oct. 16, at 2:42 AM EDT (06:42 UTC) from SLC-40 at the CCSFS in Florida. Falcon 9 will carry 21 satellites on a due south trajectory toward a polar orbit. Supporting this flight is booster B1093, which will be flying for the seventh time. The booster will land atop SpaceX’s west coast droneship Of Course I Still Love You. The final Falcon 9 launch of the week is scheduled for Monday, Oct. 20, at 7:00 AM PDT (14:00 UTC) from SLC-4E in California. Booster B1075 will deliver a further 28 v2 Mini Starlink satellites into the constellation’s Group 11 shell for the Starlink Group 11-5 mission. The booster first flew on June 3, 2021."
