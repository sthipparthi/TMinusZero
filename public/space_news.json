Orienspace secures B+ round funding as it moves towards a test flight, Space News reports.\"Nobody’s waving the white flag here until the last hour of the last day\" Orienspace secured funding of between $27 million and $124 million. The capital will be used mainly for the follow-up development and mass production of the Gravity-2 medium-lift liquid launch vehicle. Rocket Lab sees Neutron as a contender to ease the bottleneck in demand from both commercial and military customers for a ride to space. SpaceX founder Elon Musk says heat shield tiles almost entirely stayed attached. SpaceX wants to be able to refly Starships within 24 hours. It takes more than 200 tanker trucks traveling from distant refineries to deliver all of the methane, liquid oxygen, and liquid nitrogen for a Starship launch. You don't need to know everything, only what’s important. After all, you don’t need to be a genius to know how to get things done. You just need to do what you need to get the job done.

In school, you had a growing interest in the stars, and that’s a science, astronomy is science. The math was, I wouldn’t say it was easy, but it came reasonably naturally to me. I did physics with a concentration in theoretical physics, which drove me a little crazy because it was really difficult. Ames is the birthplace of the science of astrobiology. Ames is also home to the Ames Research Center. Ames has a reputation for innovation and leading the field. Ames was rocked by the loss of its lab at the end of the last decade. The Ames team is now focused on developing climate models for exoplanets. I was also very lucky to work on a number of astrophysics projects where I think we made some significant discoveries. One I’m particularly proud of was using the Chandra X-ray Telescope. I think it’s made a significant contribution to understanding not only the possibilities for life but also the possibility for planets themselves. The physicist has two daughters who are now in their twenties, one has just graduated from college and the other is getting close to graduating. \"I’m extremely proud of them both. It’s really exciting as a parent to see them beginning to find their way in the world,\" he says. I like to mow the lawn because you can see the results of your work immediately. I like hedge trimming as well, which may be the British side of me! We like carefully pruned hedges and shrubbery. I’m a pretty good cook, although cooking for me is primarily because I enjoy it. I don’t like the process of traveling but I like it when I get there. JWST is asking readers to send in pictures of things they find interesting. If there’s a JWST image that you find particularly appealing or interesting, one that we might we see on the wall of your office or in your house, you can include that and others when you return the edited transcript. Among the images I find most interesting are the earth from space. NASA scientist John Grunsfeld has written over five hundred pieces for Scientific American over ten years.

The RIT team is developing new readout modes that are not available in commercial CMOS sensors. These custom modes sample the signal over time (a \"ramp\" acquisition) to enable the detection and removal of cosmic ray artifacts. In one mode, when the system identifies an artifact, it segments the signal ramp and selectively averages the segments to reconstruct the original signal. SPSCMOS technology promises to be a game-changer for exoplanet and general astrophysics research. These sensors will enhance our ability to detect and analyze distant worlds.

The latter has ignited speculation about its potential ties to Starship’s Human Landing System. SpaceX has not commented on the rig’s intended use, and observers caution that it could be for more mundane applications. The new structure could theoretically support a compact prototype of the HLS lander, outfitted with essential systems for lunar landing simulations. It might house an array of sensors positioned above a mock lunar terrain to refine autonomous landing capabilities, which are crucial for HLS."
