The rock, dubbed Cheyava Falls, was discovered by NASA’s Perseverance rover in June 2024 within the ancient river valley of Neretva Vallis. Cheyava Falls is among the youngest sedimentary rocks analyzed by Perseverance. This challenges earlier assumptions that biosignatures would only survive in formations far older than those currently known. This has reignited discussions about NASA’s Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission, which aims to bring Martian rocks back to Earth."

NISAR will use two different radar frequencies to penetrate clouds and forest canopies. Combining data from these two radars will allow researchers to systematically and globally map Earth. The radar reflector will be used to direct and receive microwave signals from the two radars. By interpreting the differences between the L-band and S-band measurements, researchers will be able to discern characteristics about the surface below. As NISAR passes over the same locations twice every 12 days, scientists can evaluate how those characteristics have changed over time. The OCO mission hasn’t just about been about data and hardware. The human stories woven through the mission’s successes and setbacks are really what holds the mission together. OCO-3 extends the global CO 2 measurement record while adding new capabilities made possible by being on ISS. GEDI’s lasers have been operating nominally and the mission has continued to produce high-quality observations.

Leads for the thematic working groups (WG) presented synthetic overviews of the research efforts of their group members. Following these presentations, breakout groups convened to discuss future activities of the WGs. Short summaries of each presentation are available below. Goetz reviewed the meeting goals and objectives. The Hydrology–Permafrost–Wetlands WG focused on the processes controlling changes in permafrost distribution and properties. The Disturbance Working Group WG leads presented their decade-long perspective on disturbance-related research in the ABoVE domain. ASTM11 participants watched the film, “ Scotty Creek Research Community - The Spirit of Collaboration ,” about the SCRS. ABoVE participated in multiple strategies to communicate research results to the public. ABoVE continued collaborating through knowledge exchange with early-career researchers and interns. ASTM11 featured 41 research posters across three sessions, organized by thematic area. Table 1 below provides all the project titles, presenter names, and links to each project and presentation. The UAF Arctic Research Open House was an opportunity for ST members and the public to explore the wide range of research happening at UAF. Many of the ABoVE collaborators were able to present at ASTM11. The UAF Alaska Fire Science Consortium, Bureau of Land Management Alaska Fire Service, and local artist Klara Maisch collaborated to develop the Wildfire Walk. A series of presentations on the overall structure and outcomes of ABoVE were held during ASTM11. Ryan Pavlick provided details on the NISAR mission, which launched after the meeting on July 30, 2025. A Career Trajectory panel featured Jennifer Watts, Jonathan Wang, Brendan Rogers, and Xiaoran “Seamore” Zhu. Klara Maisch discussed her work creating science-informed artwork through interdisciplinary collaborations.  ASTM11 brought together an interdisciplinary team for a final team meeting that showcased the many accomplishments made over the past decade. The group outlined current gaps and needs in Arctic and boreal research and discussed possibilities for future NASA terrestrial ecology campaigns. While this was the last meeting of this ST, research for some projects will continue into 2026."

The sample, called “Sapphire Canyon,” contains potential biosignatures, according to a paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature. “This finding by Persevereance, launched under President Trump in his first term, is the closest we have ever come to discovering life on Mars,\" says acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy. The discovery was particularly surprising because it involves some of the youngest sedimentary rocks the mission has investigated. An earlier hypothesis assumed signs of ancient life would be confined to older rock formations. This finding suggests that Mars could have been habitable for a longer period or later in the planet’s history than previously thought."

This unlocks comprehensive 5G mobile service with performance akin to “comparable” ground-based LTE. Paired with earthly 5G setups, Starlink could vanquish all coverage gaps on the planet."

Dragonfly will explore impact craters where water may have existed in liquid form for thousands of years. Areas of Titan, in the wake of impacts, would be much like a primordial Earth when life started here billions of years ago. This will be NASA's first landing on another ocean world, with the primary objective of searching for the chemical building blocks of life."

The study authors surmise it is because far less oxygen was present in the universe when the ancient brown dwarf formed. The available silicon would have bonded with hydrogen instead, resulting in silane. Brown dwarfs are often easier to study than gas giant exoplanets because the light from a faraway planet is typically drowned out by the star."

It is also a model of government efficiency and a powerful economic engine for its region. “NASA Stennis is a remarkable story of vision and innovation,” Center Director John Bailey said. On June 14, 1974, NASA Administrator James Fletcher announced the south Mississippi location would be renamed National Space Technology Laboratories. There still were many developments to come, including the first space shuttle main engine test and the subsequent 34-year test campaign. However, even in this period of early development, one thing was clear – the future lay ahead and NASA Stennis was on its way."

NASA Stennis is the choice location for a range of agencies, organizations, offices, and companies. For Relativity Space, the “unparalleled infrastructure” at NASA St Dennis has been key to enabling its rocket engine testing. The National Data Buoy Center was the very first NASA Stennis federal city tenant, arriving onsite in September 1970. Various Navy functions eventually located continuing operations onsite, including the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command, the Naval Oceanographic Office, and the Navy Office of Civilian Human Resources. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security credits the “high-quality, secure, and resilient” NASA St Dennis site for its decision to location information technology and applications operations on site."
