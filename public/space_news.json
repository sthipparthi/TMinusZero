The Dawn data revealed evidence of molecules needed to fuel microbial metabolisms on Ceres. While the finding doesn’t confirm that microorganisms existed on Ceres long ago, it does support theories that the dwarf planet may haveonce been capable of supporting single-celled lifeforms. If Ceres ever hosted life, it would have been approximately 2.5 to 4 billion years ago. During that time, warm fluids would have filled Ceres’ subsurface water reservoirs, creating environments rich with nutrients and molecules needed for life. Many dwarf planets also lack satellites or parent planets, resulting in a lack of internal heating."

Teams have endured explosions and failures, but also achieved triumphs through amazing reentries, catches of Boosters, and even the reuse of a Booster. After 10 flights of Starship, the Program stands on the doorstep of a new generation of vehicles and possible ship reuse in 2026. SpaceX has completed four flights of its Falcon 9 rocket. The first flight, Flight 1, was a success with all 33 engines running for the entire ascent burn. The lessons learned from this flight paved the way for Ship 25 and Booster 9. Ship 25 nearly made it to second stage engine cutoff (SECO), but it was lost due to a fire in the aft section. Flight 5 would launch on Oct 13, 2024, and to this date, it is the most successful flight in the Starship program. This flight also involved an upgraded heat shield for Ship 30 to better survive reentry by introducing an ablative layer under the tiles. The next flight, SpaceX aimed to achieve the fastest turnaround so far with the launch pad and a new set of vehicles. The hope was that with Ship 33+, SpaceX would be able to get into orbit, perform the refueling demonstration, and catch a ship. SpaceX has completed 10 flights of its Block 2 Starship rocket. Flight 10 was the first flight to test the new heat shield design of Block 2. The final Block 2 flight is likely set to be sometime in October of 2025. Following Flight 11, SpaceX will transition to Block 3 of Starship."

Duffy's remarks followed a Congressional hearing on Wednesday during which former Congressman Jim Bridenstine said China had pulled ahead of NASA and the United States. Duffy: \"Sometimes we can let safety be the enemy of making progress\" \"We can’t side on the side of doing nothing because we are too afraid of taking risk,\" he says. \"We have to be able to take some leaps,\" he adds."
