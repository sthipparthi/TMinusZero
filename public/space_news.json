    "detailed_news": "The FAA and the Department of the Air Force gave the green light for SpaceX to more than double its launch cadence from its workhorse launch pad in Florida. The FAA issued a 21-page document called a Mitigated Finding of No Significant Impact and Record of Decision (FONSI/ROD) The FAA is currently working through the EIS process when it comes to bringing SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket to Florida. The Final EA was published this week by the U.S. Department of the Interior. SpaceX is required to conduct species monitoring for creatures like sea turtles, the Florida scrub-jay and the southeastern beach mouse. The FAA determined that plans proposed by SpaceX as evaluated by the Final EA wouldn’t violate the relevant section of the Endangered Species Act. SpaceX's Proposed Action includes construction of a new landing zone at SLC-40. It would consist of a 280-foot diameter concrete pad with a 60-foot-wide gravel apron. Roughly two acres of Florida scrub-jay and about seven acres of a combination of grassy areas, existing roads and infrastructure would be impacted. SpaceX announced during the launch campaign of the Crew-11 mission to the International Space Station that it would end its use of LZ-1 with that mission. SpaceX launched 60 more Starlink internet satellites at 10:59 p.m. EST Monday (0359 GMT Tuesday) aboard a Falcon 9 rocket from pad 40 at Cape Canaveral."

The first T1TL satellites will go through some early testing and then will be used by some early adopters within about four to six months.

The Artemis II crew will take advantage of their location to explore the Moon from above. As the first humans to see the lunar surface up close since 1972, they’ll document their observations through photographs and audio recordings. Artemis II will be the first mission to integrate science flight control operations. The crew will be equipped with questions that scientists didn’t even know to ask during Apollo missions. Lessons learned during Artemis II will pave the way for lunar science operations on future missions.

The rock, dubbed Cheyava Falls, was discovered by NASA’s Perseverance rover in June 2024 within the ancient river valley of Neretva Vallis. Cheyava Falls is among the youngest sedimentary rocks analyzed by Perseverance. This challenges earlier assumptions that biosignatures would only survive in formations far older than those currently known. This has reignited discussions about NASA’s Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission, which aims to bring Martian rocks back to Earth."

NASA will send astronauts to explore the Moon for scientific discovery, economic benefits, and to build the foundation for the first crewed missions to Mars. NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery. For more information about Artemis visit: https://www.nasa.gov/artemis."

The Nusantara Lima (N5) satellite will be sent into a geosynchronous transfer orbit roughly 27 minutes after liftoff. The satellite is built on the same Boeing-built bus used on Intelsat’s IS-33e spacecraft, which suffered an anomaly in 2024."

    "detailed_news": "Steve Platnick stepped down effective August 8, 2025. Platnick played an integral role in the sustainability and advancement of NASA’s Earth Observing System platforms and data. NISAR will use two different radar frequencies to penetrate clouds and forest canopies. Combining data from these two radars will allow researchers to systematically and globally map Earth. The radar reflector will be used to direct and receive microwave signals from the two radars. By interpreting the differences between the L-band and S-band measurements, researchers will be able to discern characteristics about the surface below. As NISAR passes over the same locations twice every 12 days, scientists can evaluate how those characteristics have changed over time. The OCO mission hasn’t just about been about data and hardware. The human stories woven through the mission’s successes and setbacks are really what holds the mission together. OCO-3 extends the global CO 2 measurement record while adding new capabilities made possible by being on ISS. GEDI’s lasers have been operating nominally and the mission has continued to produce high-quality observations. The 2025 GEDI Science Team Meeting (STM) brought together the mission science team, competed science team. Compton J. Tucker retired from NASA in March 2025 after 48 years of public service. He was among 149 newly elected members to the National Academy of Sciences.  Compton's research achievements and all of the other scientific awards and honors received throughout his career. NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery, says Barry Lefer Associate Director of Research, Earth Science Division."
