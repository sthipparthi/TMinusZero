Later studies would suggest that a massive subsurface ocean was responsible for the jets. Now, in a new study using archival Cassini data, a team of scientists has discovered a plethora of new complex organic molecules within these jets. The speed at which the ice grains impacted the CDA proved to be important in Khawaja et al.’s analysis. “The ice grains contain not just frozen water, but also other molecules, including organics. At lower impact speeds, the ice shatters, and the signal from clusters of water molecules can hide the signals from certain organic molecules,” says Khwaja."

    "summary": "The European Space Agency’s upcoming FORUM mission is set to provide unique insights into Earth’s radiation budget, filling in a missing piece in the climate puzzle. The mission’s spectrometer will be the first space-based instrument to measure Earth’s outgoing radiation in the far-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum with unprecedented resolution and accuracy. New technologies were needed to make this possible – among these an on-ground calibration device developed by the National Metrology Institute of Germany PTB within a recent activity funded by ESA’s General Support Technology Programme. This device is used to calibrate FORUM’s onboard reference source and ensures the accurate operation of the spectrometer.",

The mission's spectrometer will be the first space-based instrument to measure Earth's outgoing radiation in the far-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum with unprecedented resolution and accuracy. New technologies were needed to make this possible. Extra temperature sensors will help identify any variations in the measurements. If this proves to be an effective way of detecting degradation, it could become a valuable method applicable to other missions. A twin blackbody, identical to the one in space, would be operated on ground, in conditions resembling space as closely as possible."
