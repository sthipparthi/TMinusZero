William C. “Willie” McCool after the pilot of Columbia on STS-107, is scheduled to launch atop a Falcon 9 on the NG-23 mission on Sunday, Sept. 14. Falcon 9 will liftoff from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS) in Florida. The launch window is instantaneous, as is typically the case with many flights to the International Space Station (ISS) The Cygnus XL cargo ship will rendezvous with the ISS on Wednesday, Sept. 17. The spacecraft will be berthed to the Station’s Unity node module nadir port. The berthing process differs from docking in that the spacecraft do not connect to the station under their own power. Once unberthed and released, the spacecraft will deorbit and perform a destructive reentry. NG-23 is the first Cygnus spacecraft to fly since the NG-21 mission in August 2024. The next cargo flight to the Station after NG-23 mission will be the first launch of Japan’s HTV-X cargo ship, which is currently scheduled for Oct. 21. The damaged NG-22 spacecraft will be manifested on a future mission."

I went through every frame of film that was captured from launch to splashdown on every mission. The final 300 that are in the book are those that are either aesthetically stunning, or they're a big transformation. Saunders has been working on the book since the middle of 2019, nonstop. There are only about 100 million photos from the Space Shuttle era. The process I used for this, on the low-quality 16 mm film, was to stack hundreds of frames. To see this level of detail, to me, it's just like a portrait of courage."

SpaceX executive Bill Gerstenmaier gave a talk and answered questions at the American Astronautical Society’s Glenn Space Technology Symposium in Cleveland. With this next flight, SpaceX aims to test measures to prevent burn-through similar to what was observed on Flight 10. For Flight 11, there are no regulatory holdups as long as SpaceX aligns with current suborbital flight. SpaceX confirms that Block 3 won’t fly until next year, which was expected, given the current state of all the components. Flight 11 will be suborbital as well as Flight 12 to test the new designs. If that goes well, they may proceed to orbit and attempt a catch as early as Flight 13."

The Final EA was published this week by the U.S. Department of the Interior. SpaceX is required to conduct species monitoring for creatures like sea turtles, the Florida scrub-jay and the southeastern beach mouse. The FAA determined that plans proposed by SpaceX as evaluated by the Final EA wouldn’t violate the relevant section of the Endangered Species Act. SpaceX's Proposed Action includes construction of a new landing zone at SLC-40. It would consist of a 280-foot diameter concrete pad with a 60-foot-wide gravel apron. Roughly two acres of Florida scrub-jay and about seven acres of a combination of grassy areas, existing roads and infrastructure would be impacted. SpaceX announced during the launch campaign of the Crew-11 mission to the International Space Station that it would end its use of LZ-1 with that mission. SpaceX launched 60 more Starlink internet satellites at 10:59 p.m. EST Monday (0359 GMT Tuesday) aboard a Falcon 9 rocket from pad 40 at Cape Canaveral."

    "detailed_news": "A massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami off Russia in late July tested an experimental detection system. The system flagged distortions in the atmosphere and issued notifications to subscribed subject matter experts. Within about 10 minutes of receiving data, it can produce a snapshot of a tsunami’s rumble. Tsunamis are most often caused by large undersea earthquakes, but not always. Volcanic eruptions, underwater landslides, and certain weather conditions in some geographic locations can all produce dangerous waves. Key to this effort is the network of GNSS stations around the world supported by NASA."

The findings are expected to provide vital insights for future missions to destinations beyond low Earth orbit, including Mars. “The lessons we learn from this crew will help us to more safely accomplish deep space missions and research,” an engineer says. Artemis missions will be the farthest NASA astronauts have ventured into space since the Apollo era. NASA also plans to use the Artemis II mission to help scientists characterize the radiation environment in deep space. Several CubeSats, shoe-box sized satellites that will be deployed into high-Earth orbit during Orion’s transit to the Moon, will probe the near and deep space radiation environment. NASA explores the unknown in air and space, innovates for the benefit of humanity, and inspires the world through discovery.
