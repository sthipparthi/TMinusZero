At other events this week, representatives from those companies will be sharing their plans. It’s day 33 of the partial government shutdown. House Speaker Mike Johnson decided on Friday to keep the House out of legislative session for yet another week. The shutdown can only end if enough Senate Democrats/Independents decide to vote with most Republicans. There are quite a few interesting events here and overseas. There are lots of great meetings and conferences on tap this week. We highlight a few names that probably are familiar to the readers of this website. There does not appear to be a virtual option. Check back throughout the week for others we learn about later and add to our Calendar."

This variant of the Starship is set to be one of the landers for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Artemis program. The ship will operate alongside tankers and depots to refuel, enabling it to deliver not only people but also approximately 100 tons of cargo to the lunar surface. SpaceX has completed 49 milestones so far in the development of HLS. Docking adapter qualification has been achieved in conjunction with NASA and Lockheed. Landing leg testing, which included the dropping of a full-scale article at flight energies onto simulated lunar regolith, has also been completed. SpaceX currently has two test tanks at their Masseys test area. The first full flight test of Block 3 is scheduled to involve Booster 18 and Ship 39 and is expected to launch sometime in Quarter 1 of 2026. Currently, neither vehicle is complete in construction, and, based on the best timelines using past boosters and ships as reference points, neither will likely begin cryogenic proof testing until December. Ship 39 has a few noticeable changes, even though it is only a couple of sections into stacking. SpaceX has refined the design of the ship catch pins and relocated them to the nosecone. The common dome has moved down slightly, which means SpaceX will be able to load more LCH4 into the tank. Another significant addition is a probe-and-drogue docking system."

The first operational Starlink satellites launched a little more than half a decade ago with a mass of about 300 kg and a capacity of 15Gbps. Starlink V3 satellites will likely mass 1,500 kg.

Shenzhou 20 is China's second mission to the Tiangong 1 space station. The CZ-2F rocket has the capacity to lift 8,400 kg to low-Earth orbit. The Shenzhou spacecraft has a larger internal habitable volume than the Soyuz spacecraft, and is similarly limited to three crew. Shenzhou-20 crew will return to Earth in early November. Crew may even exceed the longest single-mission stay of 192 days, set by Shenzhou-18 in 2024. Commander Chen Dong is the first taikonaut to spend over 400 days in space. The new crew will spend around six months on the station."

Japan's HTV-X cargo ship pulled alongside the International Space Station on Wednesday. India seeks to dramatically scale up its annual launch cadence to 50 missions a year. ArianeGroup will transfer responsibility for the assembly of Ariane 6 Vinci upper-stage engines from France to Germany. The number 135 is equal to the number of NASA’s space shuttles over the 30-year lifetime of the program. The mission came nearly a week after SpaceX launched its 10,000th Starlink satellite to date.

The former NASA Administrators called on the space agency to rethink its plans to land astronauts on the Moon using SpaceX's Starship. They said development of the revolutionary vehicle was taking too long and required unnecessary complexity. Bridenstine argued that the current architecture using Starship for Artemis 3 crewed landing means that the “probability of beating China approaches zero rapidly” He suggested a more Apollo-style route of launching both Orion and the lander on one flight of the SLS rocket equipped with the Exploration Upper Stage being built by Boeing. Liftoff came on the heels of leaders from the U.S. Space Force gathering to discuss how to adjust to a rapidly increasing launch cadence for both the Eastern Range and Western Range. “Since it’s definitely a competitive environment, I probably won’t say too much about it, but we did just kick off that work with NASA,” Cortese said."
