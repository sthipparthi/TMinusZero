The mount itself was built at the production site, then rolled to the launch site and installed on the legs on July 31, 2021. Pad 1 propelled the Starship program through the early years and now moves towards the new phase of operations. The booster test stand turned launch mount has reached the end of its life. The first-ever static fire on Pad 1 occurred on Aug 9, 2022, with a single engine test from Booster 7. The first stack of the first set of actual flight vehicles occurred on Oct 11, 2022. A Wet Dress Rehearsal was completed with Booster 7 and Ship 24 on Jan 23, 2023. A full-duration 10-second 33 engine static fire wouldn’t occur until Aug 25, 20 23, with Booster 9. Pad 1 performed 28 cryogenic proof and tanking tests, 15 spin primes, 34 static fires, six wet dress rehearsals, four aborted launch attempts, and 11 Full Stack flight tests. The quickest turnaround time for Pad 1 was 37 days between Flight 5 and Flight 6."

The challenge is designed to accelerate technologies that will help humankind live and work sustainably on the Moon. Last week, eight teams demonstrated robotic systems capable of collecting and processing lunar soil. The winning team is expected to be announced at the end of November. Team ASTROLITH developed Kirb-e, a robotic system built for Moon-like conditions designed to dig and sort lunar soil. Using a rover equipped with rotating shovels, the team successfully collected and processed large quantities of regolith simulant. The material was then funneled into a rotary sieve to separate it by particle size. The rover collects lunar soil using a rotating tube, which also acts as the internal storage in which it remains. To reduce the risk of dust interfering with moving parts, they sealed the chassis and minimised exposed mechanisms. Although they faced challenges with motor drivers and software integration, the team was proud to complete and test their system."

    "detailed_news": "Jared Isaacman is a billionaire entrepreneur, two-time private astronaut, and philanthropist known for raising over $250 million for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital during the Inspiration4 mission. Isaacman cleared a significant hurdle on April 9, 2025, passing the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation with a 19-9 vote. But political turbulence derailed the process. NASA was left with Petro as Acting Administrator and no permanent replacement in sight. In a surprising turn, Trump appointed Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy as NASA’s new Acting Administrator in July 2025. Duffy, a close ally of the President, received unexpected support from Isaacman, who even flew Duffy in his MiG-29 fighter jet."

    "detailed_news": "A SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage flew Thursday for the 21st and final time. The rocket wasn’t fitted with landing legs or grid fins as they were not needed. This was the 134th orbital launch of 2025 for SpaceX, tying the total number of launches it achieved for all of 2024. The launch was originally scheduled for Wednesday night, but was delayed 24 hours for reasons not disclosed. SpaceX's first full-size stainless steel Starship test vehicle stands some 164 feet tall and measures wider than the cabin of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet. If Elon Musk has his way, it will fly to an altitude of 65,000 feet before the end of the year. SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket with 60 Starlink internet satellites."
