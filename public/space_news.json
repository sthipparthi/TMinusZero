Later in the week, China will launch the crewed Shenzhou 21 mission to the Tiangong space station. Starlink Group 11-23 is set to launch from SLC-4E at Vandenberg on Thursday, Oct. 30. 28 Starlink v2 Mini satellites will be launched into a 53.16-degree-inclination LEO. Falcon booster B1063 will support the mission, flying on its 29th mission after a 32-day turnaround. The final Falcon 9 mission of the week is scheduled to be the rideshare Bandwagon-4 mission. The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) is scheduled to launch the CMS-03 mission atop its Launch Vehicle Mark-3 (LVM-3) rocket on Sunday, Nov. 2, at 10:30 UTC. The payload on this mission is the GSAT-7R satellite, specifically designed for the Indian Navy. This mission will mark the 140th Falcon 9 mission of 2025, and SpaceX’s 585th mission of all time."

It will dock at the ISS on Wednesday. Another Russian spacewalk will take place the day before (Tuesday) China is getting ready to launch a new crew, Shenzhou-21, to their Tiangong-3.

The challenge is designed to accelerate technologies that will help humankind live and work sustainably on the Moon. Last week, eight teams demonstrated robotic systems capable of collecting and processing lunar soil. The winning team is expected to be announced at the end of November. Team ASTROLITH developed Kirb-e, a robotic system built for Moon-like conditions designed to dig and sort lunar soil. Using a rover equipped with rotating shovels, the team successfully collected and processed large quantities of regolith simulant. The material was then funneled into a rotary sieve to separate it by particle size. The rover collects lunar soil using a rotating tube, which also acts as the internal storage in which it remains. To reduce the risk of dust interfering with moving parts, they sealed the chassis and minimised exposed mechanisms. Although they faced challenges with motor drivers and software integration, the team was proud to complete and test their system."

    "detailed_news": "The European Space Agency’s Council at Ministerial Level is the time for bold vision and decisive action. FutureEO is a driving force for innovation and excellence across satellite missions, Earth system science and Earth action. To date, seven Earth Explorer missions have been launched successfully. FutureEO will be structured around three pillars: Foundations, Missions and Data, and Earth Action. The Foundations pillar is the engine that powers every future Earth observation mission. It lays the groundwork for science, technology and mission preparation. The Earth Action pillar turns Earth observation into real-world impact, delivering benefits for science and society. The Next Generation Gravity Mission will provide unmatched insight into how ‘mass’ moves within the Earth system. WIVERN is the eleventh mission to be selected for implementation as an Earth Explorer. The Climate Change Initiative , EO for Society and the Global Development Assistance element will now be integrated into Earth Action."
