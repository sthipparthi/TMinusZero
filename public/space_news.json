Progress, Cargo Dragon, and Cygnus spacecraft continue to fly vital missions to keep humanity’s presence in low-Earth orbit going. Japan is also readying its HTV-X cargo spacecraft for its first flight this month. Sierra Space's Dream Chaser, however, is no longer targeted to fly to ISS on its first demonstration mission. The Cygnus XL S.S. launched atop a Falcon 9 from SLC-40 at CCSFS on Sept. 14. This was the first flight of the CygnUS XL version of Northrop Grumman’s cargo spacecraft, featuring an eight-meter-long cargo module. NG-23 carried 5,000 kg of cargo to the Station, including a variety of experiments, as well as the usual selection of hardware and consumables. The HTV-X spacecraft is scheduled to fly on Oct. 20 atop a H3-24L rocket from the Tanegashima Space Center. The spacecraft offers the ability to carry large items of unpressurized cargo that other cargo ships would not be able to fly to the Station. The next launch to the ISS will be the Soyuz MS-28 crewed mission, which is currently set for Nov. 27.  NASASpaceflight.com will take part in the 25th anniversary of NASA's space shuttle program. The program will take place over the course of the next 15 years, starting in 2025 and ending in 2025. NASA will be taking part in a number of events during that time, including a spacewalk."

Their catalogue is the first ever to include the speeds and directions of motions for dust devils all over Mars. By tracking how fast the dust devils moved, the researchers found wind speeds of up to 44 m/s. This is faster than we’ve ever measured with rovers on the ground – though it’s worth noting that the martian air is so thin that a human would barely even notice a wind of 100 km/h on Mars. Until now, our models of Mars’s climate have been based on the limited data we have from missions that don’t really cover much of the surface. Thanks to this study, we now have lots of new measurements from all over Mars. This improves our understanding and predictions of wind patterns around the Red Planet."

Blue Origin scrubbed the planned launch Tuesday of the company’s suborbital New Shepard booster from West Texas due to a “ground infrastructure issue,” and later said the flight would be pushed back to early 2019. SpaceX and ULA would launch five and two missions respectively as part of the latest round of National Security Space Launch contract assignments."

    "detailed_news": "The Senate again failed to pass a Continuing Resolution to reopen government agencies like NASA that are closed due to a lapse in appropriations. House Speaker Mike Johnson decided this afternoon to keep the House out of session next week as a further attempt to force the Senate to agree to the House-passed CR. If the Senate does not agree to his CR, the shutdown cannot end at least until the House returns to approve any changes. The House will meet in pro forma sessions next week as it did this week. Once she is sworn in, there will be 214 Democrats, giving them a slighter edge. Voters in Texas and Tennessee will soon fill two other vacancies. The longest shutdown was 35 days during President Trump’s first term."

    "detailed_news": "Rocket Lab’s ambitious push to launch its Neutron medium-lift rocket before the end of the year is entering the home stretch. CEO Sir Peter Beck tells NSF that his team is “literally sleeping in the factories” to meet the aggressive timeline. The 141-foot-tall reusable launch vehicle has passed several critical milestones in recent months. Neutron's modular first stage splits into a boost section containing engines and pressurization systems. A boost module might fly 20 times before retirement, while an upper module could reach 50-100 flights. Neutron offers three mission profiles: return-to-launch-site (RTLS) for propulsive landings back at Wallops’ Launch Complex 3. Neutron will follow Electron’s flight cadence philosophy: one launch in the first year, three in the second, then five, scaling from there. Rocket Lab won a $24 million Space Force contract to develop the upper stage. A confidential commercial satellite operator has booked two Neutron missions."

    "detailed_news": "Christopher Scolese, director of the agency in charge of U.S. spy satellites, says he's worried about hackers. The worry is justified, and the attack surface is vast. A well-placed digital intrusion could cascade through an entire satellite network. The challenges are magnified by the rapid commercialization of space. War-gaming and red-teaming exercises that simulate cyber intrusions are not luxuries but necessities. The NRO’s decision to shift toward proliferated constellations of smaller satellites is one way to hedge. Redundancy in space is resilience against both kinetic and cyber threats."
