The license authorizes one initial launch, and covers up to 16 flights per year from the SaxaVord spaceport situated 80 km to the northeast of mainland Scotland on the northernmost of the Shetland Islands. Despite being awarded the long-awaited UK license, the company might yet decide to conduct a second launch of Skylark L from another site. Skyrora has developed a containerized ‘spaceport in a box’ concept, which means that it doesn’t especially need a pad to launch from. The company’s first vehicle, the Skylark Nano, launched from the Kildermorie Estate in Ross-shire in August 2018. The relationship with the Langanes Peninsula of Iceland began with the launch of the two-stage Skylarks. Skylark L is the company’s second rocket, following the Skylark Micro. The vehicle stands 11.6 m tall and 0.7 m wide. It is powered by a combination of High-Test Peroxide (HTP) and kerosene. Skyrora uses in-house distillation processes to reach the strength needed. In 2019, Skyrora located and returned parts of this rocket’s first stage to the UK, marking its 48th anniversary. Although it offers a little less performance than when using cryogenics for oxidizers, HTP can be stored at room temperature."

In visible light, the spectrum of the white dwarf's atmosphere resembled that of a typical white dwarf. But Hubble's ultraviolet vision revealed that it had a very different history from what we would have guessed. The high temperature and low carbon abundance mean that identifying this white dwarf as the product of a merger would have been impossible without Hubble’s sensitivity to ultraviolet light. Because WD 0525+526's origin was revealed only once astronomers glimpsed its ultraviolet spectrum, it's likely that other seemingly “normal” white dwarfs are actually the result of cosmic collisions."

The launch occurred on August 11, 2025, at 8:35 a.m. ET from Space Launch Complex 40. SpaceX has repurposed Falcon Heavy side boosters for Falcon 9 missions in the past, including the inaugural Falcon Heavy flight in 2018. The primary deterrent has been the added mass from reinforcements, estimated at 10-20% more than a standard Falcon 9 booster. During its return, observers noticed evidence of the booster’s heavier build during the KF-02 landing."

OCO-2 is now viewed as the gold standard for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) measurements from space. Scientists from around the world have come together to bring the important data from this satellite to the broader community. The first launch in 2009 ended in failure – when a faulty launch vehicle doomed the first OCO to a watery grave. In the aftermath, the OCO community were left in limbo, unsure if the project would survive. OCO-2 can detect the faint glow given off by plants during photosynthesis. This glow offers a fast, sensitive indicator of plant health – see Figure 2 . OCO-2 and MODIS provide a global dataset of plant photosynthesis far beyond what either satellite could produce on its own. OCO-2’s synergy with its A-Train counterpart, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’S Aqua platform, makes the data even more powerful. OCO-2 and OCO-3 provide complementary perspectives on Earth’s carbon cycle and plant health at space and time resolutions that have not been possible from space before. The satellite's high-precision measurements can now detect CO 2 linked not just to countries, but large cities, industrial zones, and even individual power plants – all while researchers continue perfecting efforts to identify contributions from city sectors. The Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) of Fourier Transform Spectrometers (FTS) measure CO 2 over snow-covered ground. OCO-2 was being used to develop early drought forecasts. The “ground truth” data collected at these field sites help to ensure that the satellite is accurately measuring “Earth’s breathing” During the 2015–2016 El Niño, large tropical forests temporarily transformed into net carbon sources. OCO-2 captured the increase in atmospheric CO 2 and scientists used this data to refine estimates of how these events contribute to the global carbon budget. Scientists are combining the satellite data with wind models and urban maps to trace CO 2 to its sources."

Roman will devote about 75% of its science observing time over its five-year primary mission. High-Latitude Time-Domain Survey will be split into two imaging “tiers” — a wide tier that covers more area and a deep tier that will focus on a smaller area for a longer time to detect fainter objects. The observations will take place in two areas, one in the northern sky and another in the southern sky. There will also be a spectroscopic component to this survey, which will be limited to the southern night sky."

The launch marks ULA's return to launching payloads as part of the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program. The USSF-106 mission is comprised of two satellites. One of those remains a mystery with Space Force officials unwilling to provide any details. The other, which is described as the primary payload onboard the Vulcan rocket is the brainchild of the Air Force Research Laboratory. The mission and launch together come with a $250 million price tag. NTS-3 is being tested in the laboratory as well as out in the field. Some of the learns from this, like calibrating a spot beam antenna, can be applied to the next generation of GPS satellites, called GPS 3-F. The prime contractor that manufactured the satellite is L3Harris Technologies."
