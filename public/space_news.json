The study fulfils an important goal of Solar Orbiter: to trace ejected particles back to their sources at the Sun. Crucially, the finding is important for our understanding of space weather, where accurate forecasting is essential to keep our spacecraft operational and safe.

Lumps of material appear to be material with a different composition than the surrounding mantle. Lumps likely arrived as giant asteroids or other rocky material that struck Mars during the early solar system. The fact that such fine structures are still visible today tells us Mars hasn’t undergone the vigorous churning that would have smoothed out these lumps."

SpaceX's Starship Flight 10 took off from Pad 1 (A) at 6:30:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time. This was the second-to-last flight of a Block 2 booster with Booster 15-2 slated to be the last one to fly. The SpaceX logistics team brought in around 38 Liquid Nitrogen (LN2) tankers and around 40 LOX tankers. Ship 37 made it through reentry with no major problems. The aft flaps partially came apart, possibly due to hot-staging damage, and then early reentry tore them both open. The port or left side engine chill lines ruptured under the aft flap fairing and punched a hole into the ship’s drive section skirt."

    "detailed_news": "SpaceX launches its Super Heavy-Starship rocket for the 10th time. The rocket is the most powerful ever built, with 16 million pounds of thrust. A launch try Sunday was called off because of trouble with ground equipment. A second attempt Monday was blocked by cloudy weather. SpaceX's Starship rocket is designed to fly itself back to a launch gantry for mid-air capture. SpaceX has not yet attempted a return-to-launch-site with a Starship. The company fired up nine Merlin main engines at the bottom of a previously-flown Falcon 9 booster. A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket is set to roll to its launch pad Wednesday. The launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with a Spanish communications satellite is expected to be shuffled after the Atlas 5 flight. The mission marked the 200th Falcon 9 launch from pad 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station."

The previous three tests in January, March, and May ended in RUDs — Rapid Unscheduled Disassemblies. Under the $2.9 billion contract with NASA, SpaceX must first fly an uncrewed demonstration flight that lands on the Moon’s South Pole and lifts off again. If he misses that November-December 2026 window, he’ll have to wait another 26 months before the Earth and Mars are properly aligned to try again."
