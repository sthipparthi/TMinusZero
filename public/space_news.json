The spacecraft comes from Satelit Nusantara Lima (SNL), a subsidiary of Indonesia’s first private satellite company. The satellite is built on the same Boeing-built bus used on Intelsat's IS-33e spacecraft, which suffered an anomaly in 2024. A computer-triggered abort halted the countdown of a Falcon 9 rocket Sunday at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The next mission in SpaceX's launch surge until at least Monday. The launch was visible across Southern California and as far away as Arizona as the booster climbed into sunlight at dusk."

After ten all-up flights and more than two years, Starship has at last achieved all of the major objectives SpaceX sought to achieve. SpaceX aims to build and test the first V3 ships this year, though they may not fly until 2026. Meanwhile, Starship is still bound to its commitments to NASA and the Artemis program. Just over two years remain until Artemis III’s current public target of September 2027."

    "detailed_news": "Using data from NASA’s now-retired Dawn spacecraft, scientists have found that Ceres may have once had a lasting source of chemical energy. The Dawn data revealed evidence of molecules needed to fuel microbial metabolisms on Ceres. While the finding doesn’t confirm that microorganisms existed on Ceres long ago, it does support theories that the dwarf planet may haveonce been capable of supporting single-celled lifeforms. If Ceres ever hosted life, it would have been approximately 2.5 to 4 billion years ago. During that time, warm fluids would have filled Ceres’ subsurface water reservoirs, creating environments rich with nutrients and molecules needed for life. Many dwarf planets also lack satellites or parent planets, resulting in a lack of internal heating."

Teams have endured explosions and failures, but also achieved triumphs through amazing reentries, catches of Boosters, and even the reuse of a Booster. After 10 flights of Starship, the Program stands on the doorstep of a new generation of vehicles and possible ship reuse in 2026. SpaceX has completed four flights of its Falcon 9 rocket. The first flight, Flight 1, was a success with all 33 engines running for the entire ascent burn. The lessons learned from this flight paved the way for Ship 25 and Booster 9. Ship 25 nearly made it to second stage engine cutoff (SECO), but it was lost due to a fire in the aft section. Flight 5 would launch on Oct 13, 2024, and to this date, it is the most successful flight in the Starship program. This flight also involved an upgraded heat shield for Ship 30 to better survive reentry by introducing an ablative layer under the tiles. The next flight, SpaceX aimed to achieve the fastest turnaround so far with the launch pad and a new set of vehicles. The hope was that with Ship 33+, SpaceX would be able to get into orbit, perform the refueling demonstration, and catch a ship. SpaceX has completed 10 flights of its Block 2 Starship rocket. Flight 10 was the first flight to test the new heat shield design of Block 2. The final Block 2 flight is likely set to be sometime in October of 2025. Following Flight 11, SpaceX will transition to Block 3 of Starship."
