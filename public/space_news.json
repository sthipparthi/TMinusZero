    "summary": "Tokyo, Japan (SPX) Feb 08, 2026\n\n\nWith robots taking on more roles in daily life and industry, their evolution toward autonomous intelligence is being held back by rigid electronic hardware that cannot conform to complex, curved bodies. Traditional hard components are difficult to mount on non planar robot surfaces, which limits the integration of critical sensing, computation, and actuation functions that underpin perception, d",

Observations show that methane levels have risen over time, but researchers still lack clarity about why the rate of accumulation changes from year to year. \r\n\r\nMethane remai",
