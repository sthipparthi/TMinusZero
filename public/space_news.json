With two satellites now in orbit, eyes are already moving to the next of the satellites due to launch next year. Vibration testing will simulate the launch environment and aims to confirm the build quality of the overall satellite. There will be a final series of tests, including a System Validation Test with the ground segment operator Eumetsat in the loop, before the satellite is readied for launch, planned in 2026."

The hearing underscores ongoing debates over NASA’s strategy in the intensifying space race with China. Isaacman acknowledged challenges, including high costs, Orion issues, delayed spacesuits, and unready landers. He argued complexity is the price of ambition for a sustainable lunar presence, not just a flags-and-footprints mission."

In school, you had a growing interest in the stars, and that’s a science, astronomy is science. The math was, I wouldn’t say it was easy, but it came reasonably naturally to me. I did physics with a concentration in theoretical physics, which drove me a little crazy because it was really difficult. Ames is the birthplace of the science of astrobiology. Ames is also home to the Ames Research Center. Ames has a reputation for innovation and leading the field. Ames was rocked by the loss of its lab at the end of the last decade. The Ames team is now focused on developing climate models for exoplanets. I was also very lucky to work on a number of astrophysics projects where I think we made some significant discoveries. One I’m particularly proud of was using the Chandra X-ray Telescope. I think it’s made a significant contribution to understanding not only the possibilities for life but also the possibility for planets themselves. The physicist has two daughters who are now in their twenties, one has just graduated from college and the other is getting close to graduating. \"I’m extremely proud of them both. It’s really exciting as a parent to see them beginning to find their way in the world,\" he says. I like to mow the lawn because you can see the results of your work immediately. I like hedge trimming as well, which may be the British side of me! We like carefully pruned hedges and shrubbery. I’m a pretty good cook, although cooking for me is primarily because I enjoy it. I don’t like the process of traveling but I like it when I get there. JWST is asking readers to send in pictures of things they find interesting. If there’s a JWST image that you find particularly appealing or interesting, one that we might we see on the wall of your office or in your house, you can include that and others when you return the edited transcript. Among the images I find most interesting are the earth from space. NASA scientist John Grunsfeld has written over five hundred pieces for Scientific American over ten years.

The RIT team is developing new readout modes that are not available in commercial CMOS sensors. These custom modes sample the signal over time (a \"ramp\" acquisition) to enable the detection and removal of cosmic ray artifacts. In one mode, when the system identifies an artifact, it segments the signal ramp and selectively averages the segments to reconstruct the original signal. SPSCMOS technology promises to be a game-changer for exoplanet and general astrophysics research. These sensors will enhance our ability to detect and analyze distant worlds.

The latter has ignited speculation about its potential ties to Starship’s Human Landing System. SpaceX has not commented on the rig’s intended use, and observers caution that it could be for more mundane applications. The new structure could theoretically support a compact prototype of the HLS lander, outfitted with essential systems for lunar landing simulations. It might house an array of sensors positioned above a mock lunar terrain to refine autonomous landing capabilities, which are crucial for HLS."

Moonquakes occur along active fault lines on the lunar surface. These fault lines are cracks in the Moon’s crust that form due to the Moon's shrinking as its interior slowly cools. Scientists have identified thousands of active faults along the lunar surface that may be regularly producing moonquakes. For their study, the scientists analyzed surface changes near the Lee-Lincoln fault in the Taurus-Littrow valley. A magnitude 3.0 moonquake rattles the region once every 5.6 million years.

The House plans to take up their NDAA bill next week. The Commerce-Justice-Science (CJS) bill that funds NASA was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee on July 17. The House Appropriations Committee was supposed to mark up the CJS bill the day before recess was scheduled to begin, but the House adjourned a day early so the markup was postponed. Several other great events are on tap this week as well, including a discussion of “Space Law Across Borders” SpacePolicyOnline.com has the right (but not the obligation) to monitor the comments and to remove any materials it deems inappropriate.

What appear to be fragments from the aftermath of massive impacts on Mars that occurred 4.5 billion years ago have been detected deep below the planet’s surface. The discovery was made thanks […]",

    "detailed_news": "Rocky material that impacted Mars lies scattered in giant lumps throughout the planet’s mantle. The ancient impacts released enough energy to melt continent-size swaths of the early crust and mantle. They offer a record preserved only on worlds like Mars, whose lack of tectonic plates has kept its interior from being churned up. Lumps of material appear to be material with a different composition than the surrounding mantle. Lumps likely arrived as giant asteroids or other rocky material that struck Mars during the early solar system. The fact that such fine structures are still visible today tells us Mars hasn’t undergone the vigorous churning that would have smoothed out these lumps."
